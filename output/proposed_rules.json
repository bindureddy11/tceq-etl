The deadline for the Bexar County area to\nachieve attainment under the serious classification is September 24, 2027, with a 2026\nattainment year. Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), §182(b)(2) requires the commission to\nimplement reasonably available control technology (RACT) provisions for all major sources\nof nitrogen oxides (NO ) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the Bexar County area.\nX\nFCAA, §172(c) and §182(c) require the commission to submit serious classification\nattainment demonstration (AD) and reasonable further progress (RFP) SIP revisions to EPA.\nThe required serious classification SIP revisions (Non-Rule Project Nos. 2024-040-SIP-NR and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n2024-041-SIP-NR), along with the two concurrently proposed rulemakings (Rule Project Nos.\n2025-006-115-AI and 2025-007-117-AI) needed for implementation of required NO and VOC\nX\ncontrol measures, are due to EPA by January 1, 2026. This proposed rulemaking would\naddress FCAA RACT requirements for major sources of VOC in the Bexar County area under\nthe serious classification for the 2015 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. The proposed rulemaking\nalso contains rule revisions to achieve sufficient VOC emissions reductions to demonstrate\nthat the Bexar County area is making progress towards attainment and would achieve the\nmandated RFP reduction target for VOC.\nIn the Bexar County area, the emission profile presents unique challenges for reduction\nefforts. The county’s VOC emissions are predominantly generated by nonpoint area sources,\nwhich constitute over 70% of the total emissions inventory (EI). In contrast, RACT is typically\napplied to point sources, which are fewer in number in Bexar County and contribute a\nrelatively small fraction of overall VOC emissions. Nonpoint area sources offer the greatest\npotential for achieving significant VOC reductions in the Bexar County area. Accordingly,\ncontrol strategies used to meet the RFP VOC emissions reduction requirement in this\nproposed rulemaking emphasize controlling area sources.\nAttainment Demonstration Rulemaking Requirements\nFCAA, §172(c) mandates that the commission submit an AD SIP revision to demonstrate that\nthe Bexar County area will meet the NAAQS by its attainment date.

The commission is neither required to propose nor is it proposing any\namendments to demonstrate attainment for the Bexar County area in this rulemaking\nbecause the AD modeling demonstrates attainment without the need for additional\nmeasures. A RACM analysis to identify additional potential control measures that\ncould expedite attainment of the NAAQS earlier than the area’s attainment date is\nprovided in the concurrently proposed Bexar County 2015 Ozone NAAQS Serious AD\nSIP Revision (Non-Rule Project No. 2024-041-SIP-NR). The RACM analysis determined\nthat no potential control measures met the criteria to be considered RACM. As a result,\nno rule revisions are proposed as RACM.\nFCAA, §182(f) requires the state to submit a SIP revision that implements RACT for all\nmajor sources of nitrogen oxides (NO ). EPA defines RACT as the lowest emission\nX\nlimitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control\ntechnology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic\nfeasibility (44 FR 53761, September 17, 1979).

SB 1397, 88th Legislature, 2023,\nSection 13, amended Texas Water Code (TWC) §5.754 requiring the commission to\nconsider major, moderate, and minor violations when determining repeat violators.\nThis proposed rulemaking also addresses management recommendations adopted by\nthe Sunset Advisory Commission that were not included in SB 1397 for the\ncommission to review and update the agency’s compliance history rating formula to\nensure it accurately reflects a regulated entity’s record of violations, including\nconsiderations of site complexity and cumulative violations or repeating violations;\nand to regularly update compliance history ratings.\nSection by Section Discussion\n§60.1, Compliance History\nThe commission proposes revisions to §60.1(a)(6) and (7) to establish the effective date\nof the proposed rule. The commission will continue to use the version of the rule in\neffect at the time the compliance history classification was calculated in accordance\nwith §60.1(b). For example, when an application for a permit is received by the\nexecutive director, the version of Chapter 60 in effect at the time the application is\nreceived will be the version used for compliance history purposes. The commission\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nmay consider new compliance history information as it deems necessary.\nThe proposal amends §60.1(b) to change the compliance period for enforcement\nactions to be calculated from the initial enforcement screening date. The compliance\nhistory period for an enforcement action is currently based on the date of the initial\nmailing of the enforcement settlement offer or petition, whichever occurs first. Since\ncomplicated cases may take substantial time to develop, the compliance history period\ncould change while the settlement offer or petition is being drafted. Changing the start\nof the compliance period to the initial screening of an enforcement action means the\ncompliance history will more closely reflect the performance of the site at the time the\nviolations were documented as opposed to several months later. This provides greater\ncertainty to the regulated community as to how an entity is performing at the time an\nenforcement action begins. This also means a site’s compliance history will remain the\nsame throughout the drafting and review process of the initial proposed agreed order\nor the petition instead of requiring additional reviews to verify whether the compliance\nhistory has changed during the process. In addition, clarification is made on how\nNotices of Violation are considered consistent with changes to §60.2(f).\nProposed §60.1(c)(8) changes the language referencing the Texas Environmental,\nHealth, and Safety Audit Privilege Act. The Act was amended by the 85th Legislature in\n2017 and the proposed language recognizes this change.\n§60.2, Classification\nThe proposal amends §60.2(a) to change the frequency that the executive director shall\nevaluate the compliance history of each site from annually to bi-annually.

The SIP\nX\nmust also include procedures for the assessment and collection of the penalty fee. If the state\ndoes not impose and collect the fee, then FCAA, §185(d) requires that EPA impose and collect\nthe fee with interest, and the revenue is not returned to the state.\nFor the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard of 0.75 parts per million, on October 7, 2022, EPA\npublished a final notice that reclassified the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Houston-Galveston-\nBrazoria (HGB) 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas from serious to severe effective\nNovember 7, 2022 (87 Federal Register (FR) 60926). The DFW severe nonattainment area\nconsists of 10 counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall,\nTarrant, and Wise. The HGB severe nonattainment area consists of eight counties: Brazoria,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nChambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The DFW and HGB\nsevere nonattainment areas are required to attain the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard by July\n20, 2027. If a severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area does not attain by the attainment\ndate, the area will be subject to the penalty fee requirements upon EPA issuing a finding of\nfailure to attain for the area. For fee assessment purposes, the 2027 calendar year from January\n1, 2027, through December 31, 2027, is anticipated to be the baseline year for these severe\nnonattainment areas since it is the year that contains the attainment date. The penalty fee is\nrequired to be paid until EPA redesignates the area as attainment for the 2008 eight-hour ozone\nstandard or EPA takes action that results in termination of the fee.\nAs stated in FCAA, §182(d)(3) and (e) and §185, the required penalty is $5,000 per ton, as\nadjusted for inflation by the consumer price index (CPI), of VOC and/or NO emissions emitted\nX\nin excess of 80% of a major stationary source’s baseline amount. A baseline amount would be\ndetermined for each pollutant, VOC and/or NO , for which the source meets the major source\nX\napplicability requirements. A source that is major for VOC emissions would be subject to the\nfee on VOC emissions; a source that is major for NO emissions would be subject to the fee on\nX\nNO emissions; and a source that is major for both VOC and NO emissions would be subject to\nX X\nthe fee on both VOC and NO emissions.\nX\nThe major stationary source’s fixed baseline amount is proposed to be calculated as the lower\nof the baseline emissions or total annual authorized emissions during the baseline year; the\nbaseline amount must be adjusted downward to account for unauthorized emissions and/or\nemissions limitations in effect as of December 31 of the baseline year or timeframe used to\ndetermine the baseline amount. The major stationary source’s baseline emissions are defined as\nthe annual routine emissions reported to the TCEQ point source emissions inventory (emissions\ninventory) according to 30 TAC §101.10, excluding emissions not authorized by permit or rule,"

The commission adopted revisions to Chapter\n114 and the I/M SIP on November 29, 2023, to implement an I/M program in Bexar\nCounty by no later than November 1, 2026 (Project Nos. 2022-026-114-AI and 2022-\n027-SIP-NR).\nThe I/M rules require the commission to implement the I/M program in conjunction\nwith the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) and require vehicles registered in I/M\ncounties to pass an emissions inspection at the time of their annual safety inspection.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nThe 88th Texas Legislature, 2023, Regular Session, passed two bills that impact the\nTexas I/M program and require rulemaking and a revision to the I/M SIP. House Bill\n(HB) 3297 eliminated the mandatory annual vehicle safety inspection program for\nnoncommercial vehicles, effective January 1, 2025. A rulemaking and SIP revision are\nrequired to remove references and requirements related to the state’s safety inspection\nprogram and to revise several provisions in the SIP that are outlined in the bill. Senate\nBill (SB) 2102 extends the initial registration and inspection period for rental vehicles\nfrom two years to three years. A rulemaking and SIP revision are required to allow one\nadditional year of exemption from emissions inspections for rental vehicles.\nThe rulemaking will also provide for an overall clean-up of the rule language to remove\noutdated program-related definitions, references, and requirements. This clean-up is a\nresult of the 2023 quadrennial rule review required for Chapter 114. The clean-up\nprocess will include revisions to the rule and SIP to remove a provision of the I/M rule\nrelated to vehicles operated by any federal government agency employee under the\njurisdiction of a federal government agency that has not been approved as part of the\nTexas SIP by EPA.\nDemonstrating Noninterference under Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), §110(l)\nUnder FCAA, §110(l), EPA cannot approve a SIP revision if it would interfere with\nattainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), reasonable further\nprogress toward attainment, or any other applicable requirement of the FCAA.
