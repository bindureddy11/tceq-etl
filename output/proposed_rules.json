    "full_text": "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 1\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission)\nproposes new §§39.1, 39.405, 39.409, 39.419, 39.422, 39.501, 39.503, 39.606, 39.804;\nand amendments to §§39.402, 39.403, 39.405, 39.407, 39.411, 39.412, 39.419, 39.420,\n39.423, 39.425, 39.426, 39.501, 39.503, 39.509, 39.510, 39.551, 39.553, 39.601, 39.603,\n39.604, 39.605, 39.651, 39.707, 39.803, 39.804, 39.807, 39.808, 39.809, 39.810, 39.902,\n39.903, 39.1003, 39.1005, 39.1009, and 39.1011.\nIf adopted, proposed new §§39.1, 39.405, 39.409, 39.419, and 39.606, and amended\n§§39.402, 39.405, 39.407, 39.411, 39.412, 39.419, 39.420, 39.426, 39.601, 39.603,\n39.604, and 39.605 and will be submitted to the United States Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP).\nBackground and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules\nTCEQ underwent Sunset review during the 88th Regular Legislative Session, 2023. The\nSunset bill, SB 1397, continuing TCEQ, included provisions requiring changes to\nTCEQ’s public participation rules, which are found primarily in Title 30 Texas\nAdministrative Code (TAC) Chapters 39, Public Notice, and 55, Requests for\nReconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment.\nThe agency engaged in an extended stakeholder process for this rulemaking. A hybrid\nvirtual/in-person stakeholder meeting was held in Austin on July 15, 2024, with in-\nperson meeting rooms also open in TCEQ regional offices in Midland and Harlingen.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nSpanish-language interpretation was available for this meeting. In-person meetings\nwere held in Arlington on July 16, 2024, and in Houston on July 18, 2024. Because the\nJuly 18, 2024, meeting in Houston was shortly after the city experienced Hurricane\nBeryl, a second in-person meeting was held in Houston on October 3, 2024.\nProfessional Spanish-language interpretation was available at both Houston meetings,\nand an agency interpreter was available for Spanish language assistance at the\nArlington meeting. Stakeholder comments were accepted until October 8, 2024. The\nagency received robust participation from stakeholders during this process, receiving\nmany comments and suggestions for changes to improve the agency’s public\nparticipation rules.\nThe TCEQ Sunset bill required the extension of the public comment period and\nopportunity to request a hearing for a subset of air quality permit applications.\nSpecifically, air quality permit applications that are required to publish notice in a\nconsolidated Notice of Receipt of Application and Intent to Obtain Permit (NORI) and\nNotice of Application and Preliminary Decision (NAPD) (consolidated notice) must\nextend the close of the comment period and the opportunity to request a contested\ncase hearing to at least 36 hours following the public meeting held on the permit\napplication. The Sunset bill also required TCEQ to post permit applications\nelectronically on TCEQ’s website and make these available to the public.\nDuring the stakeholder process, a large number of comments requested that the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 3\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nextension of the comment period and opportunity to request a contested case hearing\nfollowing a public meeting be given to all types of permit applications. Although many\nother comments were beyond the scope of the current rulemaking, there was a general\nrequest to make the rules less confusing and more helpful to the public participation\nprocess. The proposed amendments to Chapter 39, along with the companion\nrulemaking proposing changes to Chapter 55, seek to improve and clarify the rules in\naddition to satisfying the requirements of the Sunset bill.\nThe proposed rulemaking will remove obsolete date references throughout Chapter 39\nand correct minor grammatical issues to reflect current correct usage. A new\nSubchapter A for definitions will be added to define several commonly used terms.\nUpdates to notice requirements are proposed that will require the addition of an email\naddress to the information for an agency contact. The agency has already implemented\nthe Sunset bill requirement to electronically post administratively and technically\ncomplete applications on its website. Information about the availability of this\ninformation and how to find it is proposed to be added to the text of required notices.\nAdditionally, provisions are proposed to be re-structured for ease of reading\ncomprehension in some places where the current rule is in paragraph form.\nThe proposed rules will also make clear that required sign posting must remain in\nplace throughout the permit review process from the beginning until final action is\ntaken on a permit application. This can be final action by the commission, voidance of\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 4\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nan application, or withdrawal of an application by the applicant. Also, documents\nrequired to be posted by applicants in a public place must remain in place throughout\nthe permit review process from the beginning until a final action is taken on a permit\napplication. These proposed changes make explicit in the rule language the agency’s\npolicy to make application information available throughout the comment period, and\nthe changes are intended to reduce confusion on the part of both the public and the\nregulated industry. The commission is also proposing to add a new subsection in\nSubchapter H to detail how the commission will provide notice to the public when a\ncomment period is extended.\nThe comment period and deadline to submit comments and request a contested case\nhearing will be extended for at least 36 hours following the close of a public meeting\nfor air quality permits that have consolidated notice, as required by the Sunset bill,\nthat are received on or after March 1, 2026. Because permit applications are being\nsubmitted and reviewed constantly, the new rule requirements need an\nimplementation date by which the new rules will apply to permit applications. The\ncommission is proposing that this date will be March 1, 2026, for this new requirement\nand July 1, 2026 for other proposed new requirements. The commission is specifically\nsoliciting comment on the appropriateness of these dates as implementation dates for\nthe proposed new requirements.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 5\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nFor air quality permit applications for a renewal that would not result in an increase in\nallowable emissions and would not result in the emission of an air contaminant not\npreviously emitted, and the application does involve a facility for which the applicant's\ncompliance history is in the lowest classification under Texas Water Code (TWC),\n§5.753 and §5.754 and the commission's rules in 30 TAC Chapter 60, relating to\nCompliance History, the comment period is for 15 days following a single notice; and a\nrequest for a contested case hearing must be received during this period to be\nconsidered timely. However, the rules are silent as to the impact of a poor compliance\nhistory on the comment period. Therefore, the commission is proposing to specify that\nif an application for a renewal that would not result in an increase in allowable\nemissions and would not result in the emission of an air contaminant not previously\nemitted and the applicant's compliance history is in the lowest classification under\nTWC, §5.753 and §5.754 and the commission's rules in 30 TAC Chapter 60, then the\ncomment period would be extended to 30 days or within 30 days of filing of the\nexecutive director’s RTC. This is implied by the current rule language that\ndifferentiates an applicant that does not have a compliance history that is in the lowest\nclassification, but the proposed change is intended to reduce confusion among both\nthe public and regulated industry stakeholders by making the difference explicit.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 6\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nCurrently, the information about how to request a contested case hearing for air\nquality applications is found only in Subchapter H, §39.411. This can be a source of\nconfusion for all stakeholders seeking to understand the public participation\nprocesses for air quality permit applications. To make this information easier to\naccess, the commission is proposing a new section in Subchapter K, Public Notice of\nAir Quality Permit Applications. The new section is proposed to have the information\nabout requesting a public meeting, a notice and comment hearing, and a contested\ncase hearing for those air quality permit applications for which these opportunities\nexist.\nComments were also received during the stakeholder process about the difficulties of\nreading posted signs for air quality permit applications. Agency experience is that\noften the posted signs are one of the first ways that the public becomes aware of a\npotential new plant being built. However, the signs can be difficult to read from the\nroad. The commission is proposing to increase the size of these signs. The Municipal\nSolid Waste (MSW) program also has sign-posting requirements, with a larger required\nsize than currently required for air quality permit applications. The proposed rules\nwould increase the size of the required signs to 48 inches by 48 inches, with a\nminimum size of 3 inches for lettering, consistent with the current requirements in the\nMSW program. The commission is specifically soliciting comments on the proposed\nchange, including the proposed size of the signs.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 7\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nSection by Section Discussion\nNew Subchapter A. Definitions\nThe commission is proposing a new Subchapter A, Definitions, to provide clarity\nrelating to commonly used terms in Chapter 39. Proposed new §39.1(1)-(8) defines\nadministratively complete application, contested case hearing, notice and comment\nhearing, public comment, public meeting, response to comment, request for\nreconsideration, and technically complete application.\nSubchapter H. Applicability and General Provisions.\nThe commission is proposing to delete §39.402(a)(10) as obsolete. The deadline of\nJanuary 1, 2018 in this provision has passed, and the commission has no FutureGen\napplications to which this provision applies. The commission is specifically soliciting\ncomment on the appropriateness of this deletion. The remaining §39.402(a)(11) and\n(12) are proposed to be re-numbered to (a)(10) and (11), and (b)(2) is proposed to be\namended to update the reference to reflect the change in numbering. The commission\nis also proposing to delete obsolete language in §39.403(a).\nThe commission is proposing to amend §39.405(g)(1) and (2) to add clarifying language\nto make clear that an application must remain available for the entirety of the time an\napplication is under review and to amend §39.405(g)(3) to replace “issues” with “the\napplication” to be more accurate. New §39.405(l) adds new language for applications\nthat are administratively complete on or after June 1, 2024, to require the executive\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 8\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\ndirector to make the administratively complete and technically complete applications\navailable on the commission’s website until final action is taken on an application and\nthere is no further opportunity for commission review. This requirement exempts\nmaterials that would be overly burdensome or too large for posting on the\ncommission’s website, as allowed by SB 1397. The date in this section of the rule is the\ndate on which the commission began making applications electronically available, as\nrequired by SB 1397.\nProposed amendment to §39.407 improves clarity and requires that persons\nrequesting to be on the mailing list provide a valid mailing address.\nThe commission proposes to restructure §39.409 as new language is proposed to be\nadded. Proposed new §39.409(a) is the current existing language. Proposed new (b)\nclarifies when comments must be received to be considered timely. Proposed new (c)\nstates that the executive director may extend a comment period for any reason; and\nnew (d) states that when a comment period is extended, the requirements of §39.422,\nrelating to Notice of Extension of Comment Period, will apply.\nThe proposed amendment to §39.411(b)(1) requires an email address for the agency\ncontact. Proposed amendments to §39.411(b)(5) re-word and re-structure for improved\nreadability. The proposed amendment to §39.411(b)(8) requires, for applications\nadministratively complete on or after May 1, 2026, a statement that a copy of the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 9\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nadministratively complete application can be found online at the commission’s\nwebsite; and the location of the website must be included in the notice.\nProposed amendments to §39.411(c)(2) re-word and re-structure for improved\nreadability. The proposed amendment to §39.411(c)(5) requires, for applications\nadministratively complete on or after May 1, 2026, a statement that a copy of the\ntechnically complete application can be found online at the commission’s website; and\nthe location of the website must be included in the notice. Amendments to\n§39.411(d)(3) are proposed to re-word and re-structure for improved readability.\nAn amendment to §39.411(e)(1) adds the requirement for an email address for an\nagency contact. An amendment to §39.411(e)(5) fixes a language issue that appears to\nbe missing punctuation and words that makes the current language confusing. The\nproposed amendment to §39.411(e)(11)(A)(iv) replaces the date of January 1, 2017,\nwith March 1, 2026. Proposed new §39.411(e)(11)(A)(v) provides for requirements for\ninitial registrations for concrete batch plant standard permits received on or after\nMarch 1, 2026, including the requirement that if a public meeting is held, then the\ncomment period and right to request a contested case hearing extends for at least 36\nhours following the close of the public meeting. Existing §39.411(e)(11)(A)(v) is\nproposed to be renumbered to (vi) and is amended to apply existing requirements for\ntimely hearing requests to applications received before March 1, 2026. For applications\nreceived after March 1, 2026, the new requirement for the opportunity to comment\nand request a hearing to be extended to at least 36 hours following a public meeting is\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 10\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nadded, as these types of permit applications have a consolidated notice. Existing\n§39.411(e)(11)(A)(vi) is proposed to be renumbered to (vii) and amended to reflect the\nre-numbering. Current §39.411(e)(14) is proposed to be deleted, as TCEQ regional\noffices no longer keep hard copies of compliance files, and many offices do not have\nviewing capabilities for the public. Current §39.411(e)(15) and (16) are renumbered to\n(e)(14) and (15).\nThe proposed amendment to §39.411(f)(3) adds a requirement for the notice on\napplications that are declared administratively complete on or after May 1, 2026 to\ninclude a statement that the technically complete application and draft permit may be\nviewed online at the commission’s website and the location of the website where these\ncan be found. Proposed amendments to §39.411(f)(4) and (5) re-word and re-structure\nfor improved readability. The proposed amendment to §39.411(g)(1) reflects the\nproposed re-numbering of the cited subsections. Proposed amendments to\n§39.411(g)(3) re-word and re-structure for improved readability.\nThe commission is proposing to amend §39.412(b)(2)(A) to reflect the proposed re-\nnumbering of these sections. Proposed amendments to (b)(4) clarify that signs must\nremain in place until final action is taken on a permit application.\nThe commission is proposing to amend §39.419 to re-structure and re-word to clarify\nlanguage related to air quality permit applications. NAPD applies to minor NSR air\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 11\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nquality permits, and the language as written could imply that only certain major\nsources are subject to NAPD. The proposed amendments move language to (a)\nconcerning major air quality permit applications subject to Chapter 116, Subchapter B\nand add language to specify that the NAPD requirement applies to applications subject\nto Chapter 116, Subchapter E. The proposed amendment also moves language to\nspecify that NAPD does not apply to air quality permit renewal applications that do not\nhave a poor compliance history. The proposed amendment adds new (d) to specify that\nfor air applications mailed notice requirements under §39.602 requirements apply. The\nproposed amendment also renumbers (d) to (e).\nProposed amendments to §39.420(c)(1)(C)(i)(III) replace the reference to §39.402(7) to\nbe specific about the type of permit application that is being referenced. The existing\ncitation is incorrect, and it is clearer to state that the reference is to Chapter 116,\nSubchapter E of this title, relating to Hazardous Air Pollutants: Regulations Governing\nConstructed or Reconstructed Major Sources (FCAA, §112(g), 40 CFR Part 63), whether\nfor construction or reconstruction. Proposed new §39.420(c)(1)(C)(i)(IV) clarifies that\nno-increase renewal applications that have the lowest compliance history rating do\nreceive information related to contesting the permit application.\nProposed new §39.422 will specify how the executive director will provide notice when\na comment period is extended. Proposed new (a) states that the executive director can\nextend any comment period for good cause, mirroring §55.152(a)(8); (b) requires the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 12\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\ncommission to post notice on its website when a comment period is extended for\napplications administratively complete on or after May 1, 2026; (c) requires the\ncommission to provide electronic notice of an extension of a comment period to those\npersons who have subscribed to receive informal electronic notices through the permit\nnotice by email system for applications that are administratively complete on or after\nMay 1, 2026; and (d) requires that alternative language requirements in §39.426 apply\nwhen notice of an extension of a comment period is required.\nAn amendment is proposed to §39.426 (a)(1)(B) to remove an obsolete date\nrequirement.\nSubchapter I\nA proposed amendment to §39.501(a) will remove obsolete date language.\nObsolete language related to applicability date is proposed to be removed from\n§39.503(a).\nObsolete language related to date of applicability is proposed to be removed from\n§39.509(a). A reference to an obsolete notice process and an extra word in existing\nlanguage is proposed to be deleted from (b). A proposed amendment to (c) replaces a\ncitation to a specific paragraph with a citation to the subsection that contains\ninformation regarding an applicant held meeting. A proposed amendment to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 13\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\n§39.510(a)(5)(A) adds the requirement for the email of the agency contact.\nSubchapter J\nA proposed amendment to §39.551(a) will remove obsolete language related to the\napplicability date. The proposed amendment to §39.553 (b)(3)(D) adds the requirement\nfor an email for the agency contact.\nSubchapter K\nThe removal of obsolete language regarding date of applicability in §39.601 is\nproposed.. Proposed amendments to (c) remove the obsolete date reference.\nThe proposed amendment to §39.604(a)(1) states that for permit applications\nadministratively complete on or after May 1, 2026, the signs must be 48 inches by 48\ninches in size with text at least 3 inches high. This change mirrors the requirements\nfor the size of signs in §39.510(b)(1). The commission is specifically soliciting\ncomment on this change and the proposed size of signs. The proposed amendment to\n§39.604(b) clarifies that signs must remain posted until final commission action on a\npermit application. An amendment to remove obsolete language from §39.605(1)(D) is\nproposed.\nThe commission is proposing new §39.606, Contested Case Hearings and Public\nMeetings, to specify the details on information related to contested case hearings and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 14\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\npublic meetings on air quality permit applications. Proposed new (a)(1)-(7) lists the\ntypes of air quality permit applications for which a contested case hearing may be\nrequested. Proposed new (b) lists the types of air quality permits for which a notice\nand comment hearing may be requested. Proposed new (c) lists the time periods by\nwhich a request for contested case hearing must be received to be considered timely\nfor different types of air quality permits. Proposed (c)(1) states that for an application\nthat is for a renewal of an air quality permit that would not result in an increase in\nallowable emissions and would not result in the emission of an air contaminant not\npreviously emitted and the application does not involve a facility for which the\napplicant's compliance history is in the lowest classification under TWC, §5.753 and\n§5.754 and the commission's rules in 30 TAC Chapter 60 of this title, relating to\nCompliance History, a request for a contested case hearing must be received by the\nend of the 15-day comment period following NORI. Proposed new (c)(2) states that for\nan application that is for a renewal of an air quality permit that would not result in an\nincrease in allowable emissions and would not result in the emission of an air\ncontaminant not previously emitted and the application does involve a facility for\nwhich the applicant's compliance history is in the lowest classification under TWC,\n§5.753 and §5.754 and the commission's rules in 30 TAC Chapter 60, relating to\nCompliance History, a request for a contested case hearing must be received by end of\nthe comment period or within 30 days of the mailing of the Response to Comments.\nProposed (c)(3) lists the requirements for permit types that have a consolidated notice\n– applications for concrete batch plant standard permits and permit amendment\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 15\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\napplications issued under Chapter 116, Subchapters B and G of this title (relating to\nNew Source Review Permits and Flexible Permits), for which the executive director has\ndeclared the application administratively and technically complete and prepared a\ndraft permit within 15 days of receipt of the application. Because these types of\napplications must receive an extension of the comment period and opportunity to\nrequest a contested case hearing if a public meeting is held of at least 36 hours\nfollowing the end of the meeting, the requirements are clearly listed for the different\nscenarios. For permit applications received before March 1, 2026, the current\nrequirements in §39.411(e) are repeated here, and a request for a contested case\nhearing must be received within 30 days following the publication of the combined\nnotice for the opportunity to request a hearing to continue to exist. If a request is\nreceived within 30 days, then the right to request a hearing is present until 30 days\nfollowing the mailing of the executive director’s Response to Comments. For permit\napplications received on or after March 1, 2026, a request for a contested case hearing\nmust be received within 30 days following the publication of the combined notice for\nthe opportunity to request a hearing to continue to exist unless a public meeting is\nheld on the application. If a public meeting is held, then the opportunity to comment\nand request a contested case hearing is extended for at least 36 hours following the\nend of the public meeting. Additionally, a request for a contested case hearing can be\nsubmitted for up to 30 days following the mailing of the executive director’s Response\nto Comment, if an otherwise timely hearing request is received.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 16\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nProposed new §39.606(c)(4) and (5) allow for a request for a contested case hearing to\nbe received by the end of the comment period or within 30 days after the executive\ndirector’s Response to Comments is mailed for air quality applications and\namendments subject to the requirements for Prevention of Significant Deterioration\nand Nonattainment permits in Chapter 116, Subchapter B, or the requirements of\nChapter 116, Subchapter E. These are major New Source Review permit applications\nand amendments. Proposed new §39.606(c)(6) applies to all other applicable air quality\npermit applications and requires that the request for a contested case hearing must be\nreceived by the end of the 30-day comment period following the final publication of\nthe Notice of Receipt of Application and Intent to Obtain Permit. If no hearing request\nis received during this time, then there is no longer an opportunity to request a\ncontested case hearing. If a request is received during the required time frame, then\nthe right to request a hearing is extended to 30 days after the mailing of the executive\ndirector’s Response to Comments.\nProposed new §39.606(d) lists the things that must be included in a request for a\ncontested case hearing (CCH): (d)(1) requester’s location; (d)(2) description of how the\nrequester is impacted differently than the general public; and (d)(3) the form\nrequirements of Chapter 55. Proposed new (e) specifies that only relevant and material\nissues raised during the comment period can be considered if a CCH is granted.\nProposed new (f) specifies that for an application for a registration to use a concrete\nbatch plant standard permit, only someone who resides within 440 yards of the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 17\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nproposed plant is an affected person who is entitled to a contested case hearing.\nProposed new (g) states that the executive director may hold a public meeting on\npermits listed in (a)(3), (4), and (6) if requested by a member of the legislature who\nrepresents the general area where the facility is to be located or if there is substantial\npublic interest in the proposed activity; and proposed new (h) states that the executive\ndirector may hold a public meeting on permits listed in a(1), (2), and (5) if requested by\na legislator or any interested person or if there is substantial public interest.\nSubchapter L\nThe proposed amendment to §39.651(a) will delete obsolete language related to the\napplicability date.\nSubchapter M\nA minor grammar fix is proposed for §39.713(2).\nSubchapter N\nAn amendment is proposed for §39.803(a) to provide clarity. The proposed\namendment to §39.803(f) and proposed new §39.804(b)(10) add citations to §39.405(l),\nrequiring that the application be posted on the commission’s website. The proposed\namendment to §39.804(a)(1) adds a requirement for an email for the agency contact.\nThe proposed amendment to §39.804(b) replaces the word remediation with remedial\nfor clarity. The proposed amendments to §39.807(b)(1) and (2) add language to clarify\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 18\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nthat it is the post-closure order and preliminary decision that is being published and\nmailed. The proposed amendment to §39.809(b) removes extra words for clarity.\nSubchapter O\nProposed amendments to §39.902 adds the requirement for an email address for the\nagency contact to (b)(12). The proposed amendment to add the requirement for an\nemail address for the agency contact is added to §39.903(b)(9).\nSubchapter P\nThe proposed amendment to add the requirement for an email address for the agency\ncontact is added to §39.1003(b)(4) and §39.1005(b)(4). The commission proposes to\namend 39.1009(a) to delete the requirement to include in the public notice the location\nand phone number of a regional office to be contacted for information about accessing\na public copy of the application because the commission posts a copy of the\napplication on the commission’s website, the TCEQ public education program provides\ncustomer service to the public regarding pending applications, and the location of a\npublic copy of the application is not readily available to the individual who answers the\nphone at a region office. Proposed amendment to §39.1011(b)(4) adds the requirement\nfor an email address for the agency contact.\nFiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government\nKyle Girten, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 19\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nfirst five-year period the proposed rules are in effect, no fiscal implications are\nanticipated for the agency or for other units of state or local government as a result of\nadministration or enforcement of the proposed rule.\nPublic Benefits and Costs\nMr. Girten determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are\nin effect, the public will benefit from improved public participation opportunities that\nare consistent with requirements and recommendations resulting from the Sunset\nreview of TCEQ during the 88th Legislative Session. Additionally, the public will benefit\nfrom the removal of obsolete information, clarifications, and other nonsubstantive\nchanges. The proposed rulemaking is not anticipated to result in fiscal implications for\nindividuals.\nLocal Employment Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Local\nEmployment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking does\nnot adversely affect a local economy in a material way for the first five years that the\nproposed rule is in effect.\nRural Community Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 20\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nfive years that the proposed rules are in effect. The amendments would apply\nstatewide and have the same effect in rural communities as in urban communities.\nSmall Business and Micro-Business Assessment\nNo adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro-businesses due to the\nimplementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Small\nBusiness Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does\nnot adversely affect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nGovernment Growth Impact Statement\nThe commission prepared a Government Growth Impact Statement assessment for this\nproposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a\ngovernment program and will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative\nappropriations to the agency. The proposed rulemaking does not require the creation\nof new employee positions, eliminate current employee positions, nor require an\nincrease or decrease in fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking amends an\nexisting regulation, and it does not create, expand, repeal, or limit this regulation. The\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 21\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nproposed rulemaking does not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject\nto its applicability. During the first five years, the proposed rule should not impact\npositively or negatively the state’s economy.\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination\nThe commission reviewed the rulemaking action in light of the regulatory analysis\nrequirements of Texas Government Code (TGC), §2001.0225, and determined that the\naction is not subject to TGC, §2001.0225, because it does not meet the definition of a\n\"Major environmental rule\" as defined in that statute. A \"Major environmental rule\" is a\nrule the specific intent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risks to\nhuman health from environmental exposure, and that may adversely affect in a\nmaterial way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,\nthe environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.\nAdditionally, the proposed rulemaking does not meet any of the four applicability\ncriteria for requiring a regulatory impact analysis for a major environmental rule,\nwhich are listed in Tex. Gov’t Code Ann., §2001.0225(a). Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.,\n§2001.0225 applies only to a major environmental rule, the result of which is to: 1)\nexceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by state\nlaw; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically\nrequired by federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract\nbetween the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 22\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nimplement a state and federal program; or 4) adopt a rule solely under the general\npowers of the agency instead of under a specific state law. The proposed amendments\ndo not exceed an express requirement of state law or a requirement of a delegation\nagreement and were not developed solely under the general powers of the agency but\nare authorized by specific sections of the Texas Government Code and the Texas Water\nCode that are cited in the Statutory Authority section of this preamble. Therefore, this\nrulemaking is not subject to the regulatory analysis provisions of TGC, §2001.0225(b).\nThe proposed rulemaking is not specifically intended to protect the environment or\nreduce risks to human health from environmental exposure, nor does it affect in a\nmaterial way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,\nthe environment, or the public health. The purpose of the proposed rulemaking is to\nupdate and clarify the requirements for public participation in the permitting process\nfor air quality, water quality, and waste permit applications. The proposed rulemaking\nwould implement the requirements in the Sunset Bill, SB 1397, 88th Regular Legislature,\nas well as other recommended changes. The TCEQ Sunset bill required the extension of\nthe public comment period and opportunity to request a hearing for a subset of air\nquality permit applications. The Sunset bill also required TCEQ to post permit\napplications electronically on its website and make these available for the public.\nFollowing extensive stakeholder outreach, the commission is proposing that the\ncomment period and opportunity to request a contested case hearing will be extended\nfor at least 36 hours following a public meeting for air quality permit applications that\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 23\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nhave a consolidated notice. The proposed rulemaking will update and clarify language\nrelating to public meetings, comment periods, and contested case hearings, update\nwhat language is required in the text of notices, and clarify other information related\nto public participation in the permitting process.\nThe commission invites public comment regarding the Draft Regulatory Impact\nAnalysis Determination during the public comment period. Written comments on the\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination may be submitted to the contact\nperson at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nTakings Impact Assessment\nThe commission evaluated the proposed rulemaking and performed an analysis of\nwhether Texas Government Code (TGC), Chapter 2007, is applicable. The proposed\namendments are procedural in nature and would not burden private real property. The\nproposed amendments do not affect private property in a manner that restricts or\nlimits an owner's right to the property that would otherwise exist in the absence of a\ngovernmental action. Consequently, this rulemaking action does not meet the\ndefinition of a taking under TGC, §2007.002(5). The proposed amendments do not\ndirectly prevent a nuisance or prevent an immediate threat to life or property.\nTherefore, this rulemaking action would not constitute a taking under TGC, Chapter\n2007.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 24\nChapter 39 – Public Notice\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nConsistency with the Coastal Management Program\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rules and found that they are neither\nidentified in Coastal Coordination Act implementation rules, 31 TAC §505.11(b)(2) or\n(4), nor would the amendments affect any action or authorization identified in Coastal\nCoordination Act implementation rules, 31 TAC §505.11(a)(6). Therefore, the proposed\namendments are not subject to the Texas Coastal Management Program.\nWritten comments on the consistency of this rulemaking may be submitted to the\ncontact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nEffect on Sites Subject to the Federal Operating Permits Program\nThe proposed amendments, new sections, and repealed sections would not require any\nchanges to outstanding federal operating permits.\nAnnouncement of Hearing\nThe commission will hold a hold a hybrid virtual and in-person public hearing on this\nproposal in Austin on Monday, September 8, 2025, at 2:00pm in building F room 2210\nat the commission's central office located at 12100 Park 35 Circle.

The\nSunset bill, SB 1397, continuing the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality\n(TCEQ), included provisions requiring certain changes to TCEQ’s public participation\nrules, which are found primarily in Title 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Chapters\n39 and 55.\nThe agency engaged in an extended stakeholder process for this rulemaking. A hybrid\nvirtual/in-person stakeholder meeting was held on July 15, 2024, in Austin, with in-\nperson meeting rooms also open in TCEQ regional offices in Midland and Harlingen.\nSpanish language interpretation was available for this meeting. In-person meetings\nwere held on July 16, 2024, in Arlington and on July 18, 2024, in Houston. Because the\nJuly 18, 2024, meeting in Houston was shortly after the city experienced a hurricane, a\nsecond in-person meeting was held in Houston on October 3, 2024. Professional\nSpanish-language interpretation was available at both Houston meetings, and an\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nagency interpreter was available for Spanish language assistance at the Arlington\nmeeting. Stakeholder comments were accepted until October 8, 2024. The agency\nreceived robust participation from stakeholders during this process, receiving many\ncomments and suggestions for changes to improve the agency’s public participation\nrules.\nThe TCEQ Sunset bill required the extension of public comment period and\nopportunity to request a hearing for a specific subset of air quality permit\napplications. Specifically, air quality permit applications that are required to publish\nnotice in a consolidated Notice of Receipt of Application and Intent to Obtain Permit\n(NORI) and Notice of Application and Preliminary Decision (NAPD) (consolidated\nnotice) must extend the close of the comment period and the opportunity to request a\ncontested case hearing to at least 36 hours following a public meeting held on the\npermit application. During the stakeholder process a large number of comments\nrequested that this extension be given to all types of permit applications. Although\nmany other comments were beyond the scope of the current rulemaking, there was a\ngeneral request to make the rules less confusing and more helpful to assist the public\nparticipation process. The proposed amendments to Chapter 55, along with the\ncompanion rulemaking proposing changes to Chapter 39, seek to improve and clarify\nthe rules in addition to satisfying the requirements of the Sunset bill.\nThe proposed amendments in Chapter 55 will expand the current definitions section to\nadd definitions relating to the public participation processes. The proposed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 3\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\namendments will extend the public comment period and opportunity to request a\ncontested case hearing for at least 36 hours following the close of a public meeting for\nair quality permit applications with consolidated notice. This proposed requirement\nwill apply to applications that the executive director receives on or after March 1,\n2026. Because the agency is continually processing permit applications, a specific date\nby which new requirements will be in place is necessary to ensure smooth and fair\nprocessing of permit applications and not require current applications to follow new\nrequirements that do not exist when the applications are submitted. As the executive\ndirector has the authority to extend comment periods and the requirement for the\nextension has been a statutory requirement since September 1, 2023, when the agency\nhas held public meetings for air quality permit applications with consolidated notice,\nthe comment period has been extended. The current rule changes will make that\nrequirement clear to both the regulated industry and the public. The commission is\nspecifically soliciting comments on an appropriate date for these requirements to\napply in rule. The proposed amendments will specify that the commission will follow\nnew notice procedures that are being proposed in Chapter 39 when a comment period\nor period to request a contested case hearing is extended, to allow the public to know\nwhat the process is. The proposed amendments will clarify and update language,\nincluding removing a requirement for a fax number and adding a requirement for a\nvalid email address in requests submitted to the commission for a contested case\nhearing or request for reconsideration. Further proposed changes update language to\nconform with current stylistic and grammar conventions.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 4\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nSection by Section Discussion\nSubchapter D. Applicability and Definitions.\nCurrent §55.103 is proposed to be amended to revise and clarify the existing definition\nfor affected person as new §55.103(1). Proposed new §§55.103(2)-(7) will add new\ndefinitions for contested case hearing, personal justiciable interest, motion to\noverturn, motion for rehearing, public meeting, and request for reconsideration. These\nare terms that the public has indicated consistently cause confusion; therefore, the\nnew definitions are intended to provide clarity and assist the public in understanding\nthe different components that are part of public participation process.\nSubchapter E. Public Comment and Public Meetings.\nSection §55.152(b) is proposed to be amended to extend the public comment period to\nat least the close of a public meeting by adding new §55.152(b)(1) for existing language\nand §55.152(b)(2) to specify that the comment period is extended for at least 36 hours\nfollowing the close of a public meeting for air quality applications with a consolidated\nNotice of Receipt of Application and Intent to Obtain Permit and Notice of Application\nand Preliminary Decision that are received by the executive director on or after March\n1, 2026. Proposed new §55.152(c) specifies that any extension of time for filing public\ncomments or hearing requests must follow the notice procedures of §39.422 (relating\nto Notice of Extension of Comment Period). New §55.152(d) specifies that timely\ncomments are those received by the Office of the Chief Clerk by the end of the\ncomment period. Section 55.154(a) is proposed to be amended to add the word\n“hearing” to be clear that a public meeting is not a contested case hearing under the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 5\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nTexas Administrative Procedure Act.\nSubchapter F. Requests for Reconsideration or Contested Case Hearings.\nSection 55.200 is proposed to remove obsolete language regarding the date of\napplicability. Subsections 55.201(d) and (e) are proposed to be amended to remove the\nrequirement for a fax number and to add the requirement for a valid email address to\nbe included in a request for hearing. New subsection 55.201(g)(3) adds the requirement\nthat extensions of time for filing public comments or hearing requests must follow the\nrequirements of §39.422 of this title (relating to Notice of Extension of Comment\nPeriod). Subsections 55.209(d) and(g) are proposed to be amended to allow responses\nto requests for rehearing to be served by a notice which states that the responses are\nelectronically available on the commission's website, and to clarify when written\nresponses are due. The commission is specifically soliciting comments on this\nproposed change and the potential impacts on interested stakeholders. Subsection\n55.210(c)(4) is amended to extend the public comment period to at least the close of\nany public meeting, and for at least 36 hours following the close of a public meeting\nfor air quality permit applications with a consolidated notice that are received on or\nafter March 1, 2026. Subsection 55.210(c)(6) is proposed to be amended to update the\ntype of recording to the more appropriate audio recording.\nSubchapter G. Requests for Contested Case Hearing and Public Comment on Certain\nApplications.\nSection 55.250 is proposed to remove obsolete language regarding the date of\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 6\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\napplicability. Subsection 55.251(c)(1) is proposed to be amended to remove the\nrequirement for a fax number and add the requirement for a valid email address. The\nproposed amendment to §55.251(f)(2) clarifies that the commission may extend the\ntime for submission of public comments and hearing requests. New §55.251(f)(3) adds\nthe requirement that extensions of time for filing public comments or hearing requests\nmust follow the requirements of §39.422 of this title (relating to Notice of Extension of\nComment Period). Subsections 55.254(e) and (f) are amended to allow responses to\nrequests for rehearing to be served by notice that the responses are electronically\navailable on the commission's website and to clarify when written responses are due.\nSection 55.251(g) is proposed for repeal as obsolete, as the commission no longer has\nauthority over weather modification licenses or permits and Texas Water Code Chapter\n18 does allow for the opportunity for a contested case hearing on certain types of\npermit applications. The commission specifically solicits comments on proposed\nchanges and the potential impacts on stakeholders.\nFiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government\nKyle Girten, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the\nfirst five-year period the proposed rules are in effect, no fiscal implications are\nanticipated for the agency or for other units of state or local government as a result of\nadministration or enforcement of the proposed rule.\nPublic Benefits and Costs\nMr. Girten determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 7\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nin effect, the public will benefit from improved public participation opportunities that\nare consistent with requirements and recommendations resulting from the Sunset\nreview of TCEQ during the 88th Regular Legislative Session. Additionally, the public\nwill benefit from the removal of obsolete information, clarifications, and other\nnonsubstantive changes. The proposed rulemaking is not anticipated to result in fiscal\nimplications for individuals.\nLocal Employment Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Local\nEmployment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking does\nnot adversely affect a local economy in a material way for the first five years that the\nproposed rule is in effect.\nRural Community Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first\nfive years that the proposed rules are in effect. The amendments would apply\nstatewide and have the same effect in rural communities as in urban communities.\nSmall Business and Micro-Business Assessment\nNo adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro-businesses due to the\nimplementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 8\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Small\nBusiness Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does\nnot adversely affect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nGovernment Growth Impact Statement\nThe commission prepared a Government Growth Impact Statement assessment for this\nproposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a\ngovernment program and will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative\nappropriations to the agency. The proposed rulemaking does not require the creation\nof new employee positions, eliminate current employee positions, nor require an\nincrease or decrease in fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking amends an\nexisting regulation, and it does not create, expand, repeal, or limit this regulation. The\nproposed rulemaking does not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject\nto its applicability. During the first five years, the proposed rule should not impact\npositively or negatively the state’s economy.\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination\nThe commission reviewed the rulemaking action in light of the regulatory analysis\nrequirements of Texas Government Code (TGC), §2001.0225, and determined that the\naction is not subject to TGC, §2001.0225, because it does not meet the definition of a\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 9\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\n\"Major environmental rule\" as defined in that statute. A \"Major environmental rule\" is a\nrule the specific intent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risks to\nhuman health from environmental exposure, and that may adversely affect in a\nmaterial way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,\nthe environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.\nAdditionally, the proposed rulemaking does not meet any of the four applicability\ncriteria for requiring a regulatory impact analysis for a major environmental rule,\nwhich are listed in TGC, §2001.0225(a).\nThe proposed rulemaking is not specifically intended to protect the environment or\nreduce risks to human health from environmental exposure, nor does it affect in a\nmaterial way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,\nthe environment, or the public health. The purpose of the proposed rulemaking is to\nupdate and clarify the requirements for public participation in the permitting process\nfor air quality, water quality, and waste permit applications. The proposed rulemaking\nwould implement changes to comply with the requirements in the Sunset bill, SB 1397,\n88th Regular Legislature, as well as other recommended changes. The TCEQ Sunset bill\nrequired the extension of the public comment period and opportunity to request a\nhearing for a subset of air quality permit applications that have a consolidated notice.\nFollowing extensive stakeholder outreach, the commission is proposing that the\ncomment period and opportunity to request a contested case hearing be extended for\nat least 36 hours following the close of a public meeting for air quality permit\napplications with a consolidated notice that are received on or after March 1, 2026. The\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 10\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nproposed amendments will specify that the commission will follow new notice\nprocedures that are being simultaneously proposed in Chapter 39 when a comment\nperiod or period to request a contested case hearing is extended, to allow the public to\nknow what the process is. The proposed amendments will clarify and update language,\nincluding removing a requirement for a fax number and adding a requirement for a\nvalid email address in requests submitted to the commission for a contested case\nhearing or request for reconsideration. Further proposed changes update language to\nconform with current stylistic and grammar conventions.\nAs defined in TGC, TGC, §2001.0225, only applies to a major environmental rule, the\nresult of which is to: exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically\nrequired by state law; exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is\nspecifically required by federal law; exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or\ncontract between the state and an agency or representative of the federal government\nto implement a state and federal program; or adopt a rule solely under the general\nauthority of the commission. The proposed amendments do not exceed an express\nrequirement of state law or a requirement of a delegation agreement and were not\ndeveloped solely under the general powers of the agency but are authorized by specific\nsections of the Texas Government Code and the Texas Water Code that are cited in the\nStatutory Authority section of this preamble. Therefore, this rulemaking is not subject\nto the regulatory analysis provisions of TGC, §2001.0225(b).\nThe commission invites public comment regarding the Draft Regulatory Impact\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 11\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nAnalysis Determination during the public comment period. Written comments on the\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination may be submitted to the contact\nperson at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nTakings Impact Assessment\nThe commission evaluated the proposed rulemaking and performed an analysis of\nwhether Texas Government Code (TGC), Chapter 2007, is applicable. The proposed\namendments are procedural in nature and would not burden private real property. The\nproposed amendments do not affect private property in a manner that restricts or\nlimits an owner's right to the property that would otherwise exist in the absence of a\ngovernmental action. Consequently, this rulemaking action does not meet the\ndefinition of a taking under TGC, §2007.002(5). The proposed amendments do not\ndirectly prevent a nuisance or prevent an immediate threat to life or property.\nTherefore, this rulemaking action would not constitute a taking under TGC, Chapter\n2007.\nConsistency with the Coastal Management Program\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rules and found that they are neither\nidentified in Coastal Coordination Act implementation rules, 31 TAC §29.11(b)(2) or\n(4), nor would the amendments affect any action or authorization identified in Coastal\nCoordination Act implementation rules, 31 TAC §29.11(a)(6). Therefore, the proposed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 12\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\namendments are not subject to the Texas Coastal Management Program.\nWritten comments on the consistency of this rulemaking may be submitted to the\ncontact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nEffect on Sites Subject to the Federal Operating Permits Program\nThe proposed amendments would not require any changes to outstanding federal\noperating permits.\nAnnouncement of Hearing\nThe commission will hold a hold a hybrid virtual and in-person public hearing on this\nproposal in Austin on Monday September 8, 2025, at 2:00pm in building F room 2210\nat the commission's central office located at 12100 Park 35 Circle. The hearing is\nstructured for the receipt of oral or written comments by interested persons.\nIndividuals may present oral statements when called upon in order of registration.\nOpen discussion will not be permitted during the hearing; however, commission staff\nmembers will be available to discuss the proposal 30 minutes prior to the hearing.\nIndividuals who plan to attend the hearing virtually and want to provide oral\ncomments and/or want their attendance on record must register by September 4, 2025.\nTo register for the hearing, please email Rules@tceq.texas.gov and provide the\nfollowing information: your name, your affiliation, your email address, your phone\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 13\nChapter 55 – Requests for Reconsideration and Contested Case Hearings; Public Comment\nRule Project No. 2024-003-039-LS\nnumber, and whether or not you plan to provide oral comments during the hearing.\nInstructions for participating in the hearing will be sent on September 5, 2025, to those\nwho register for the hearing.\nFor the public who do not wish to provide oral comments but would like to view the\nhearing may do so at no cost at:\nhttps://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/e8de5895-29fd-4bae-9e74-\n2e1714305675@871a83a4-a1ce-4b7a-8156-3bcd93a08fba\nPersons who have special communication or other accommodation needs who are\nplanning to attend the hearing should contact Sandy Wong, Office of Legal Services at\n(512) 239-1802 or 1-800-RELAY-TX (TDD).

    "full_text": "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 1\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission) proposes\nnew §§115.260, 115.262, 115.264, 115.265, 115.266, and 115.269; and amended §§115.111,\n115.112, 115.119, 115.122, 115.129, 115.411, 115.412, 115.415, 115.416, 115.419, 115.420,\n115.421, 15.425, 115.427, 115.429, 115.440, 115.441, 115.449, 115.450, 115.451, 115.453,\n115.455, 115.458-115.461, 115.463, 115.465, 115.468, and 115.469.\nIf adopted, these rules would be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) as a state implementation plan (SIP) revision.\nBackground and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules\nOn June 20, 2024, EPA published the reclassification of the Bexar County area, consisting of\nBexar County, from moderate to serious nonattainment for the 2015 eight-hour ozone\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 0.070 parts per million (ppm), effective\nJuly 22, 2024 (89 Federal Register (FR) 51829). The deadline for the Bexar County area to\nachieve attainment under the serious classification is September 24, 2027, with a 2026\nattainment year. Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), §182(b)(2) requires the commission to\nimplement reasonably available control technology (RACT) provisions for all major sources\nof nitrogen oxides (NO ) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the Bexar County area.\nX\nFCAA, §172(c) and §182(c) require the commission to submit serious classification\nattainment demonstration (AD) and reasonable further progress (RFP) SIP revisions to EPA.\nThe required serious classification SIP revisions (Non-Rule Project Nos. 2024-040-SIP-NR and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n2024-041-SIP-NR), along with the two concurrently proposed rulemakings (Rule Project Nos.\n2025-006-115-AI and 2025-007-117-AI) needed for implementation of required NO and VOC\nX\ncontrol measures, are due to EPA by January 1, 2026. This proposed rulemaking would\naddress FCAA RACT requirements for major sources of VOC in the Bexar County area under\nthe serious classification for the 2015 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. The proposed rulemaking\nalso contains rule revisions to achieve sufficient VOC emissions reductions to demonstrate\nthat the Bexar County area is making progress towards attainment and would achieve the\nmandated RFP reduction target for VOC.\nIn the Bexar County area, the emission profile presents unique challenges for reduction\nefforts. The county’s VOC emissions are predominantly generated by nonpoint area sources,\nwhich constitute over 70% of the total emissions inventory (EI). In contrast, RACT is typically\napplied to point sources, which are fewer in number in Bexar County and contribute a\nrelatively small fraction of overall VOC emissions. Nonpoint area sources offer the greatest\npotential for achieving significant VOC reductions in the Bexar County area. Accordingly,\ncontrol strategies used to meet the RFP VOC emissions reduction requirement in this\nproposed rulemaking emphasize controlling area sources.\nAttainment Demonstration Rulemaking Requirements\nFCAA, §172(c) mandates that the commission submit an AD SIP revision to demonstrate that\nthe Bexar County area will meet the NAAQS by its attainment date. Photochemical modeling\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 3\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nfor future years indicates that the Bexar County area will meet the 2015 ozone NAAQS by\nthe mandated deadline using existing control strategies. The commission is neither required\nto propose nor is it proposing any rulemaking amendments to demonstrate attainment for\nthe Bexar County area in this rulemaking because the modeling demonstrates attainment\nwithout the need for additional measures. A reasonably available control measures (RACM)\nanalysis to identify additional potential control measures that could expedite attainment of\nthe NAAQS earlier than the area’s attainment date is provided in the concurrently proposed\nBexar County 2015 Ozone NAAQS Serious AD SIP Revision (Non-Rule Project No. 2024-041-\nSIP-NR). The RACM analysis determined that no potential control measures met the criteria\nto be considered RACM. As a result, no rule revisions are proposed as RACM.\nRACT Implementation Requirements\nFCAA, §182(b)(2) requires the commission to implement RACT provisions for all major\nsources of VOC in the Bexar County area. EPA defines RACT as the lowest emission\nlimitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control\ntechnology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility\n(44 FR 53761, September 17, 1979). RACT requirements for moderate and higher\nclassification ozone nonattainment areas are included in the FCAA to ensure that significant\nsource categories at major sources of ozone precursor emissions are controlled to a\nreasonable extent, but not necessarily to best available control technology levels expected of\nnew sources or to maximum achievable control technology levels required for major sources\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 4\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nof hazardous air pollutants. Although the FCAA requires the state to implement RACT, EPA\nguidance provides states with the flexibility to determine the most technologically and\neconomically feasible RACT requirements for a nonattainment area. This rulemaking\nproposes to implement RACT requirements for the Bexar County serious nonattainment\narea, targeting sources that emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of VOCs. The proposed rules\nwould specifically apply to offset lithographic printing operations, bakery ovens, and VOC\nstorage tanks. While the proposed RACT rules are intended to fulfill SIP obligations\nresulting from the Bexar County area’s reclassification from moderate to serious\nnonattainment, the rules are not expected to yield further reductions in VOC emissions. This\nis because RACT measures for moderate nonattainment are in effect in the area and already\naddress all known point source emission sites. Since most non-mobile VOC emissions in the\nBexar County area originate from nonpoint area sources in sectors associated with solvent\nutilization, such as smaller surface coating operations, RACT control strategies for major\nsources in this proposed rulemaking may have reduced impact and limited effectiveness.\nThe proposed compliance date for these changes, March 1, 2026, is the start of the ozone\nseason in Bexar County for the serious classification attainment year.\nRFP Reduction Requirements\nFCAA, §182(b)(1) requires the commission to demonstrate that the Bexar County area will\nachieve at least a 15% VOC emission reduction (15.85 tons per day (tpd)) from the 2017\nbaseline year. The concurrently proposed Bexar County 2015 Ozone NAAQS Serious RFP SIP\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 5\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nRevision (Non-Rule Project No. 2024-040-SIP-NR) demonstrates that the Bexar County area\nwill satisfy the 15% reduction requirement by using a combination of recently implemented\nmeasures and new rule changes. Recently implemented measures (Bexar County area\nmoderate RACT Rules, Rule Project No. 2023-116-115-AI, adopted April 24, 2024) will\nachieve 3.75 tpd in VOC reductions. New rule changes in this proposed Bexar County area\nrulemaking are expected to achieve 12.13 tpd in VOC reductions. Collectively, these\nmeasures slightly exceed the 15% VOC RFP reduction requirement of 15.85 tpd. The\nproposed rule changes encompass several sections of Chapter 115. First, amendments are\nproposed to existing rules for degreasing processes within Subchapter E, Division 1 and are\nanticipated to result in 0.49 tpd of VOC emission reductions in the Bexar County area.\nSecond, proposed revisions for fabric coating provisions outlined in Subchapter E, Division 2\nare expected to result in 1.06 tpd of VOC emission reductions in the Bexar County area.\nThird, proposed revisions to coating of metal parts and products, architectural coatings, and\nindustrial maintenance coatings provisions in Subchapter E, Division 5 are expected to\nresult in 8.46 tpd of VOC emission reductions; along with revisions to industrial cleaning\nsolvent provisions in Subchapter E, Division 6, which would result in 1.48 tpd of VOC\nemission reductions. Finally, proposed new rules in Subchapter C, Division 6, for gasoline\ndispensing nozzles and low permeation hoses from motor vehicle fuel dispensing facilities\nwould result in an estimated 0.64 tpd in VOC emission reductions in the Bexar County area.\nThe proposed compliance date for all these changes, March 1, 2026, is the start of the ozone\nseason in Bexar County for the serious classification attainment year.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 6\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nSection by Section Discussion\nThe commission proposes grammatical, stylistic, and other non-substantive changes to\nupdate the rules in accordance with current Texas Register style and format requirements,\nimprove readability, establish consistency in the rules, and conform to the standards in the\nTexas Legislative Council Drafting Manual, September 2020. These non-substantive changes\nare not intended to alter the existing rule requirements in any way and are not specifically\ndiscussed in this preamble.\nAmong these non-substantive changes is removal of version identifiers for certain tests\ndeveloped by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) in Subchapter E,\nDivisions 1, 2, and 5. Removal of the specific revision version will reference all test methods\nin these rule sections consistently. Sections affected by this change include §§115.415(1)(a),\n115.420(c)(11)(S), 115.425(1)(B), 115.450(c)(9)(C) and (F), and 115.455(a)(1)(B).\nSUBCHAPTER B: GENERAL VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND SOURCES\nDIVISION 1: STORAGE OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS\nRevisions in this division are proposed to fulfill major source RACT requirements.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 7\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.111. Exemptions\nThe commission proposes to establish exemption criteria in new §115.111(a)(17) for storage\ntanks and tank batteries storing condensate prior to custody transfer in Bexar County. To\nqualify for exemption from flashed gas control requirements, a storage tank or tank battery\nstoring condensate must have a condensate throughput greater than 3,000 barrels (126,000\ngallons) per year on a rolling 12-month basis, and owners or operators must be able to\nshow, by the test methods specified, that uncontrolled VOC emissions are less than 50 tpy\nfor individual tanks or aggregated tank batteries. This 50 tpy threshold aligns with the VOC\nRACT control requirements for major sources in Bexar County and effectively narrows the\nscope of tanks eligible for exemption to those with even lower emissions than what was\nallowed at the previous 100 tpy threshold. The exemption would become available beginning\nMarch 1, 2026. The commission proposes to remove a typographical error in language from\n§115.111(a)(15) that inadvertently repeated rule language.\n§115.112. Control Requirements\nThe commission proposes to amend control requirements in §115.112(e)(4)(E) to clarify that\nfixed roof tanks in the Bexar County area storing condensate prior to custody transfer must\ncontinue to control flashed gases if the tank’s throughput is greater than 6,000 barrels a\nyear through February 28, 2026. This is considered equivalent to a 100 tpy VOC emission\nrate or greater. Beginning March 1, 2026, proposed control requirements in new\n§115.112(e)(5)(F) specify that owners or operators of fixed roof tanks storing condensate\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 8\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nprior to custody transfer or at a pipeline breakout station must control flashed gases for\ntanks with VOC emissions greater than 50 tpy. The commission proposes to amend\n§115.112(e)(5)(E) to require that tanks at a tank battery or pipeline breakout station must\nroute flashed gases to a vapor control system if they emit 50 or more tons of uncontrolled\nVOCs annually, rather than the previous threshold of 100 tons. This 50 tpy threshold aligns\nwith the new VOC RACT major source limit.\n§115.119. Compliance Schedules\nThe commission proposes to revise §115.119(g) to establish March 1, 2026, as the\ncompliance date by which owners or operators of fixed roof storage tanks in the Bexar\nCounty area that store condensate prior to custody transfer must comply with the new\nrequirements of §115.112(e)(4)(F) and §115.112(e)(5)(E) to control flashed gases.\nDIVISION 2: VENT GAS CONTROL\nRevisions in this division are proposed to fulfill major source RACT requirements.\n§115.122 Control Requirements\nThe commission proposes to revise the rule text in §115.122(a)(3)(E) to require emission\ncontrol requirements from vent gas from bakeries in the Bexar County area by lowering the\napplicability threshold from 100 tpy to 50 tpy for major source controls. Bakeries that emit\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 9\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n50 tpy or more of VOC emissions would be required to achieve an 80% reduction in VOC\nemissions through vent gas control from affected bakery ovens. By lowering the emission\nthreshold and implementing stricter control requirements, this proposed rule revision seeks\nto address the area’s ozone nonattainment classification of serious as well as ensure\ncompliance with FCAA mandates for RACT implementation in Bexar County. Owners or\noperators of affected vent gas streams located in the Bexar County area must comply with\nthe emission specifications in the subsection beginning March 1, 2026, the compliance date\nspecified in proposed new §115.129(h).\nThe commission proposes revisions to §115.122(a)(3)(F)(iv), to prevent bakeries from\nclaiming emission credits if they make emission reductions in the range of 30% to 90%\nassociated with controlling VOC emissions from bakery oven vent gases in the Bexar County\narea. The current rule already prevents owners or operators in Bexar County with\nuncontrolled VOC emissions of 100 tpy or more from claiming emission credits under\nChapter 101, Subchapter H, Division 1 to prevent double counting of reductions for the\npurposes of the SIP. This prohibition would apply for bakeries emitting VOC at the new,\nlower threshold of 50 tpy necessary for RACT implementation, beginning March 1, 2026.\n§115.129 Counties and Compliance Schedules\nThe commission proposes to add new §115.129(h) to establish a compliance deadline of\nMarch 1, 2026, by which affected bakeries in the Bexar County area must meet updated\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 10\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nRACT requirements for 90% vent gas controls from bakery ovens. Establishing this\ncompliance date would ensure that RACT requirements are implemented as expeditiously as\npracticable and would also allow newly affected bakeries sufficient time to comply before\nthe beginning of ozone season in the attainment year for the area.\nSUBCHAPTER C: VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND TRANSFER OPERATIONS\nDIVISION 6: GASOLINE DISPENSING FACILITIES\nRevisions in this division are proposed to result in VOC reductions necessary to meet RFP\nrequirements.\nThe commission proposes to add a new Subchapter C, Division 6 to minimize Bexar County\narea gasoline dispensing facility (GDF) VOC spillage and associated gasoline transfer\nemissions from storage tanks into vehicles and containers. GDF sources would need to\ncomply with the control requirements specified in §115.262, which include the installation\nof enhanced conventional (ECO) nozzles and low permeation hoses on gasoline dispensing\npumps. Proposed Division 6 would also contain new sections with provisions for gasoline\ndispensing facility applicability and definitions, monitoring and inspection, testing and\ncertification, recordkeeping, and compliance requirements.\nAffected Bexar County area gasoline dispensing facilities would need to comply by March 1,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 11\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n2026. Bexar County area gasoline dispensing facility equipment that becomes subject to\nDivision 6 after March 1, 2026, would have 60 days to comply with its requirements.\n§115.260 Applicability and Definitions\nThe commission proposes new §115.260 to establish new GDF rules and corresponding\ndefinitions in the Bexar County area. The rules only apply to gasoline dispenser equipment\nand not equipment that dispenses diesel or other fuels. Newly proposed §115.260\nprovisions are intended to assist owners and operators in identifying Division 6 applicability\nand clarifying regulatory definitions. Proposed §115.260(b) defines a GDF as one that\nincludes retail, private, and commercial gasoline dispensing operations. It defines\nmalfunctioning equipment as equipment that is not operating according to the\nmanufacturer’s design and specifications and requires remedial action to eliminate potential\ngasoline leakage. Proposed §115.260(b) also includes definitions for gasoline dispenser,\nconventional nozzle, ECO nozzle, low permeation hose, and gasoline dispensing spillage.\nInforming owners, operators, commission staff, and the public of the new §115.260\nterminology would reduce confusion and inconsistent interpretations, which are crucial for\ncompliance and enforcement.\n§115.262 Control Requirements\nThe commission proposes new section §115.262 that would require ECO nozzle and low\npermeation hose controls on gasoline dispensing pumps in the Bexar County area. Only\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 12\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nCalifornia Air Resources Board (CARB)-certified ECO nozzles and low permeation hoses that\nsatisfy the proposed control requirements in §115.262 for reduced gasoline dispensing\nnozzle and reduced dispensing hose permeation rate gasoline emissions would be allowed.\nRetrofitting gasoline dispensing pumps with ECO nozzles and low permeation hoses\nrequired by proposed §115.262 reduces fuel drips or spills and vapor permeation, thereby\nsignificantly reducing VOC emissions from hundreds of GDFs in the county. Existing\ngasoline dispensing pumps would have until March 1, 2026, to install these items. Newly\nbuilt gasoline dispensing pumps installed after March 1, 2026, would be required to install\nthese items as soon as practicable and within 60 days of the pump’s installation. Similar to\nother regulations, the commission would allow a 60-day period for new sites to come into\ncompliance while anticipating that owners or operators of new sites will install the required\nhardware upon opening.\nThe commission also proposes work practice requirements in proposed §115.262. By\nimplementing and enforcing spill prevention procedures, training, spill clean-up and other\nwork practice requirements, GDFs can significantly minimize spills and associated VOC\nemissions. Proposed new §115.262 would require malfunctioning equipment to be repaired\nas soon as possible and before the next monthly inspection. The proposed regulation would\nrequire a GDF owner or operator to establish a policy to prohibit vehicle top-offs, require\ncovers on open gasoline containers, mandate signs to inform customers and employees of\nproper filling practices and require spills to be cleaned up as soon as possible.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 13\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.264 Monitoring and Inspection Requirements\nThe commission proposes new §115.264 to establish monthly gasoline dispensing system\nmonitoring and inspection requirements to identify leaking or malfunctioning equipment\nand facilitate timely repairs. ECO nozzles, low permeation hoses, and associated gasoline\ndispenser equipment would be inspected to ensure they were operating as intended and did\nnot contain holes or tears that could allow gasoline leakage. The 0.64 tpd VOC emission\nreductions expected to be achieved from compliance with §115.264 requirements\nnecessitates that GDF equipment remains in good condition, meets certification standards,\nand remains compliant with new rule requirements.\n§115.265 Testing and Certification Requirements\nThe commission proposes new §115.265 to establish testing and certification provisions for\nthe ECO nozzles and low permeation hoses that would be required at the affected gasoline\ndispensing facilities by proposed §115.262. Proposed §115.265 would require the use of UL\n330 (7th ed) - Underwriters Laboratories’ Standard for Hose and Hose Assemblies for\nDispensing Flammable Liquids test methods to determine compliance with the proposed\n§115.262(a)(1) low permeation hose maximum permeation limit of 10.0 grams per square\nmeters per day. ECO nozzles required to be installed by proposed §115.262(a)(3) would\nneed to meet certification and test requirements in the California Air Resources Board\nCertification Procedure for Enhanced Conventional Nozzles and Low Permeation\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 14\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nConventional Hoses for Use at Gasoline Dispensing Facilities CP-207, dated July 12, 2021,\nincluding updates and revisions.\n§115.266 Recordkeeping\nThe commission proposes new section §115.266 recordkeeping requirements to document\ncompliance with newly proposed Chapter 115, Subchapter C, Division 6 rules. Proposed\n§115.266 would require owners and operators to keep GDF equipment monthly inspection\nrecords that include the inspector’s name and inspection date; component inspected;\ninspection result and any corrective action; and the date corrective action was completed.\nGDFs would need to keep records of low permeation hose and ECO nozzle certifications as\nwell as training records, described in §115.262(b)(6). The compliance records would need to\nbe kept in a readily accessible format for a minimum of five years. Proposed §115.266\nrecordkeeping would include inspection, testing, certification, maintenance activity, and\ntraining documentation to confirm compliance with these rules. Tracking these activities\ndocuments compliance with the newly proposed Subchapter C, Division 6 rules.\n§115.269 Compliance Schedules\nThe commission proposes a compliance deadline of March 1, 2026, for Bexar County area\nGDF equipment that meets applicability requirements on or before this initial compliance\ndate. Bexar County area GDF equipment that becomes subject to Division 6 after the\nproposed March 1, 2026, compliance date would have 60 days after becoming subject to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 15\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\ncomply with its requirements. By establishing separate compliance dates in §115.269 for\nexisting GDF equipment and similar components that may be installed in the future, the\ncommission can ensure fair and consistent application of emission control requirements\nacross all the intended sources, including newly constructed ones.\nSUBCHAPTER E: SOLVENT-USING PROCESSES\nDIVISION 1: DEGREASING PROCESSES\nRevisions in this division are proposed to generate VOC reductions for RFP requirements.\n§115.411 Exemptions\nThe commission proposes to revise §115.411(a) to remove the Bexar County area’s\napplicability to exemptions currently available to degreasing operations under that\nsubsection. On March 1, 2026, degreasing operations in Bexar County subject to §115.412(d)\nwould no longer be eligible for exemptions under §115.411(a). This proposed amendment\nensures that all degreasing operations, regardless of previous exemption status, adhere to\nlower VOC content limits. The commission proposes a new subsection, §115.411(c), with\nexemptions that would apply in the Bexar County area beginning March 1, 2026. Proposed\nnew subsection §115.411(c) mirrors exemptions in current §115.411(b) for the Dallas-Fort\nWorth (DFW) and Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) areas, which would allow\nimplementation of the same lower degreasing solvent VOC content limit in the Bexar County\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 16\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\narea.\n§115.412 Control Requirements\nThe commission proposes to add a new subsection (d) to the control requirements in\n§115.412 to address VOC emissions from degreasing processes in the Bexar County area.\nThis new subsection would establish specific VOC content limits for solvents used in cold\nsolvent cleaning, open-top vapor degreasing, and conveyorized degreasing processes where\nthere previously were none. The new degreasing limits require the use of solvents with a\nVOC content of no more than 25 grams/liter. The same limit is used as a contingency\nmeasure in the DFW and HGB areas in §§115.412(b) and (c), respectively, and it is necessary\nto implement in the Bexar County area to help achieve the VOC emissions reductions\nnecessary for RFP requirements.\n§115.415 Testing Requirements\nThe commission proposes to amend §115.415(3) to implement compliance testing\nrequirements for the degreasing operations in the Bexar County area subject to §115.412(d).\nUnder the existing rule, degreasing solvent VOC content limits are listed for the DFW and\nHGB areas in §115.412(b) and (c), respectively. The proposed inclusion of new §115.412(d)\nunder §115.415(3) would specify the test method to determine VOC content for degreasing\noperations in the Bexar County area, bringing the requirements in line with other\nnonattainment areas. Accurate compliance testing, as outlined in methods specified in\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 17\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.415(3), is crucial for verifying that VOC limits are met so that intended VOC emission\nreduction targets are achieved from the implemented measures.\n§115.416 Recordkeeping Requirements\nThe commission proposes new §115.416(5) to require degreasing operation facilities in the\nBexar County area to maintain sufficient records to demonstrate compliance with the VOC\ncontent limits in §115.412(d) and applicable exemptions in §115.411.\n§115.419 Counties and Compliance Schedules\nThe commission proposes to revise the compliance schedule in subsection §115.419(h) for\ndegreasing operations to reflect new requirements. The schedule mandates that facilities\nsubject to the provisions of proposed §115.412(d) in the Bexar County area comply with the\nupdated control requirements by no later than March 1, 2026. This schedule provides\nfacilities with sufficient time to adopt the necessary control measures and make operational\nadjustments while ensuring that the required VOC emission reductions needed from\ndegreasing operations are achieved in a timely manner. In addition, the commission\nproposes a revision to §115.419(h) to remove a typographical error ‘by but’ that was a\nremnant of the prior rulemaking and remove ‘Bexar’ from the list of counties in §115.419(a).\nThe commission should have deleted this in the prior rulemaking when existing §115.419(h)\nwas added. Deleting it now provides a clear description of compliance requirements.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 18\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nDIVISION 2: SURFACE COATING PROCESSES\nRevisions in this division are proposed to generate VOC reductions for RFP requirements.\n§115.420 Applicability and Definitions\nThe commission proposes to add the descriptor \"Applicability\" at the beginning of\n§115.420(a) to improve consistency with subsequent subsections §115.420(b) and\n§115.420(c) and parallel sections in other divisions of Chapter 115. The commission also\nproposes to add definitions under new §115.420(c)(4)(A) through §115.420(c)(4)(C) for\n\"plasticizer, \" \"plastisol, \" and \"wash primer. \" These new definitions would provide\nexamples of fabric coatings that may be applied to protect or add new properties to a fabric\nsubstrate. The materials listed in §115.420(c)(4)(A) through §115.250(c)(4)(C), would help\nowners and operators, commission staff, and the public better understand what qualifies as\na \"fabric coating, \"ensuring more consistent application, compliance, and enforcement of the\nrules. The commission proposes to update the reference in §115.420(c)(11)(S) from the\noutdated \"Regulatory Guide 1.54\" issued by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in June\n1973 to the current Revision 3 of the guide, which was published in April 2017. The updated\nguide reflects the most recent requirements for protective coatings for nuclear power\nplants.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 19\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.421 Emission Specifications\nThe commission proposes to create new subparagraphs under existing §115.421(5) to\ndifferentiate proposed new requirements for fabric coating processes in the Bexar County\narea from existing requirements for other areas. Proposed subparagraph (A) would stipulate\nthe existing requirements and areas subject to them, and proposed subparagraph (B) would\nrequire owners and operators of fabric coating processes in the Bexar County area to use\ncoatings and wash primers containing 265 g/l (minus water and exempt solvent), which is a\ndecrease from the existing limit of 350 g/l. The counties and areas listed under\n§115.421(5)(A), including Bexar County, would remain subject to the requirements in\nexisting §115.421(5). Beginning March 1, 2026, the Bexar County area would then be subject\nto limits specified in §115.421(5)(B). Proposed new clauses §115.421(5)(B)(i) and\n§115.421(5)(B)(ii) would set limits for fabric coatings and wash primers at 265 g/l and for\nplastisol fabric coatings at 20 g/l (less water and exempt solvent), as applied at fabric\ncoating operations in the Bexar County area. These proposed limits are based on South\nCoast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Rule 1128, adopted on March 8, 1996, and\napproved by EPA on May 4, 1999, as documented in Federal Register at 64 FR 23774. The\nlimits are proposed based on their potential to achieve greater VOC emission reductions\nfrom fabric coating operations. These reductions are necessary to meet RFP requirements in\nthe Bexar County area.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 20\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.425 Testing Requirements\nThe commission proposes to make non-substantive changes to §115.425(1)(B) to remove\nversion identifiers for certain tests developed by the American Society of Testing and\nMaterials (ASTM). Removal of the specific revision version would reference all test methods\nin these rule sections consistently\n.\n§115.427 Exemptions\nProposed new §115.427(3)(K) and amended §115.427(6) remove exemptions from rule\nrequirements for low emitting fabric coating operations and aerosol coatings (spray paint),\nrespectively, within the Bexar County area. Beginning March 1, 2026, owners or operators\nwould be required to comply with the applicable emission specifications in §115.421 for\nfabric coatings. Proposed new §115.427(3)(K) and amended §115.427(6) exemptions allow\nfor a wider range of VOC sources to be controlled to ensure that more fabric coating sources\nadhere to lower VOC content limits. The VOC reductions from these additional sources are\nnecessary to help the Bexar County area meet RFP requirements. The commission also\nproposes to remove text in §115.427(3) in an example that references exemptions for\narchitectural coatings. The proposed changes are intended to prevent confusion and to\nmirror text from a similar example in existing §115.451.\n§115.429 Counties and Compliance Schedules\nThe commission proposes several changes in §115.429 to establish a binding deadline by\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 21\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nwhich owners and operators of affected fabric coating operations must comply with\nparticular rule provisions. Proposed amendments to §115.429(e) aim to clarify that\ncompliance with fabric coating requirements of the division are required by the compliance\ndate or within 60 days after becoming subject to the rule, if the compliance date has passed.\nThe commission proposes adding new subsection §115.429(g) to establish compliance with\nthe new fabric coating requirement in §115.421(5)(B) by March 1, 2026. The proposed\namendment to §115.429(f) indicates that fabric coating operations in the Bexar County area\ncurrently subject to this division do not have to comply with the new requirement set in\n§115.421(5)(B) until the compliance date set in newly proposed §115.429(g).\nDIVISION 4: OFFSET LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING\nRevisions in this division are proposed to fulfill major source RACT requirements and to\ngenerate VOC reductions for RFP requirements.\n§115.440 Applicability and Definitions\nThe commission proposes to lower the major source threshold for offset lithographic\nfacilities in the Bexar County area to comply with FCAA §§182(b)(2) and 182(f) RACT\nrequirements. The definitions in subparagraphs §115.440(b)(8)(D) and §115.440(b)(9)(D) for\nboth major and minor printing sources would be amended. In the existing rules, offset\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 22\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nlithographic facilities in the Bexar County area with uncontrolled VOC emissions of 100 tpy\nare classified as major sources, while those below this threshold are considered minor. The\nproposed amendments would reduce the major source threshold to 50 tpy beginning March\n1, 2026, for the Bexar County area. The definition for minor source would be revised\nsimilarly for the Bexar County area. Amendments to §115.440(b)(8)(D) and §115.440(b)(9)(D)\nwould subject offset lithographic facilities to RACT requirements at lower thresholds of\nVOC and would ensure RACT requirements are implemented as required for offset\nlithographic printing facilities in the Bexar County area.\n§115.441 Exemptions\nThe commission proposes changes to §115.441(b)(1) regarding the exemption for cleaning\nsolutions used in offset lithographic printing operations in Bexar County for minor printing\nsources. In the existing rules, minor printing sources may exempt up to 110 gallons of\ncleaning solution per year from the VOC content limits in §115.442(c)(1). The proposed\nrevision would remove this exemption for Bexar County beginning March 1, 2026. Removing\nthe §115.441(b)(1) exemption for minor printing sources in Bexar County ensures that minor\nprinting sources, regardless of previous exemption status, adhere to the lower VOC content\nlimits proposed in Subchapter E, Division 6. The change is necessary to achieve the\ncalculated VOC reductions associated with the proposed changes in Subchapter E, Division\n6, which are necessary for RFP purposes in Bexar County. This change only affects sources\nin Bexar County, not the DFW or HGB areas.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 23\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.449 Compliance Schedules\nThe commission proposes to add rule text in §115.449(j) to establish a compliance deadline\nof March 1, 2026, by which date, affected facilities in the Bexar County area must adhere to\nRACT requirements and comply with low VOC content limits for offset lithographic\noperations.\nDIVISION 5: CONTROL REQUIREMENTS FOR SURFACE COATING PROCESSES\nRevisions in this division are proposed to generate VOC reductions for RFP requirements.\n§115.450 Applicability and Definitions\nThe commission proposes to broaden the scope of surface coating operations subject to\nSubchapter E, Division 5 rules in the Bexar County area by adding architectural coatings to\nthe list of applicable surface coating processes in §115.450(a). Language would be added to\nclarify that the rule applies only to architectural coatings in a commercial context and would\nexplicitly exclude consumer use from applicability by stating that the rule applies to\ncoatings applied for compensation. The commission proposes to add relevant architectural\ncoating related definitions to §115.450 to accompany the architectural coatings VOC\ncontent limits that are proposed in §115.453. To ensure that all definitions in §115.450\nremain in alphabetical order when new definitions are added, existing definitions would be\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 24\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nreordered and renumbered accordingly.\nThe commission proposes to add §115.450(a)(9) and §115.450(a)(10) to extend the\nrequirements in Subchapter E, Division 5 to architectural coatings and industrial\nmaintenance coatings in the Bexar County area.\nThe commission proposes new §115.450(c)(11), which would provide definitions for\ndifferent types of architectural coatings with VOC limits proposed in §115.453(a)(5). These\nproposed definitions are based on South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)\nRule 1113, amended on February 5, 2016, and approved by EPA on December 31, 2018, as\ndocumented in Federal Register at 40 CFR Part 52. The added definitions include aluminum\nroof coatings, appurtenance, below ground wood preservatives, bituminous coating\nmaterials, bituminous roof primers, bond breakers, building envelope, building envelope\ncoatings, colorant, concrete-curing compounds, concrete surface retarders, default coatings,\ndriveway sealers, dry-fog coatings, faux finishing coatings, clear topcoats, decorative\ncoatings, glazes, japans, trowel applied coatings, fire-resistive coatings, flat coatings, form\nrelease compounds, gonioapparent, graphic arts coatings, interior stains, lacquers, low-\nsolids coatings, magnesite cement coatings, mastic coating, metallic pigmented coatings,\nmulti-color coatings, nonflat coatings, pearlescent, pigmented, post-consumer coatings, pre-\ntreatment wash primers, primers, reactive penetrating sealers, recycled coatings, restoration\narchitect, roof coatings, rust preventative coatings, sacrificial anti-graffiti coatings, sanding\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 25\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nsealers, sealers, shellacs, specialty primers, stains, stationary structures, stone consolidants,\nswimming pool coatings, tile and stone sealers, topcoat, tub and tile refinishing coatings,\nundercoaters, varnishes, waterproofing sealers, wood coatings, wood conditioners, and\nwood preservatives. Many of these coating variants have their own separate VOC limits in\n§115.453(a)(5). By providing definitions in this section, owners and operators can more\neasily find the appropriate VOC limit for the product they are using.\n§115.451 Exemptions\nThe commission proposes new §115.451(a)(6) to indicate that exemptions currently\nprovided in §115.451(a)(1)-(3) for low-emission architectural coating operations, industrial\nmaintenance coating operations, and metal parts and products coating operations would no\nlonger apply in the Bexar County area beginning March 1, 2026. As of that date, owners or\noperators would be required to comply with applicable control requirements of §115.453.\nThese changes are necessary to achieve all the calculated VOC reductions for RFP purposes\nin Bexar County.\nThe commission proposes to create exemptions in new subsection §115.451(q) for owners\nor operators of architectural coating operations in the Bexar County area. This new\nsubsection identifies specific architectural coatings by type and size that would be exempt\nfrom the VOC limits in §115.453(a)(1)(C) and (D). Exemptions would apply to emulsion type\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 26\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nbituminous pavement sealers (regardless of container size) under the newly proposed\n§115.451(q)(1); specific architectural coatings in containers of one liter or less are outlined\nin §115.451(q)(2)(A); and specific architectural coatings in containers of eight fluid ounces\nor less, or those used solely for touch-up are outlined in §115.451(q)(2)(B). Small containers\nof coatings, which are assumed to be used to cover small areas, contribute minimally to\noverall VOC emissions compared to larger containers. These exemptions mirror those in\nSCAQMD Rule 1113 and are necessary to achieve all the calculated VOC reductions for RFP\npurposes.\n§115.453 Control Requirements\nThe commission proposes to restructure existing §115.453(a)(1)(C) VOC content limit\nprovisions for miscellaneous metal parts and products. The existing limits apply in the\nBexar, DFW, and HGB areas, and new limits would be added for the Bexar County area. The\nexisting provisions would be relocated under §115.453(a)(1)(C)(i), and would continue to\napply in Bexar County until February 28, 2026. Compliance with proposed new\n§115.453(a)(1)(C)(ii) would be required beginning March 1, 2026, in the Bexar County area.\nExisting provisions for the Bexar, DFW, and HGB areas would be relocated, without changes,\nfrom existing Figure: 30 TAC §115.453(a)(1)(C) to proposed new Figure: 30 TAC\n§115.453(a)(1)(C)(i). Separate provisions applicable only in the Bexar County area would be\nadded under new Figure: 30 TAC §115.453(a)(1)(C)(ii). The proposed VOC content limits in\nsubparagraph §115.453(a)(1)(C)(ii) for the Bexar County area aim to reduce emissions from\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 27\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\ncoatings used in metal parts and products operations in the Bexar County area. Existing\nTable 2 under Figure: 30 TAC §115.453(a)(1)(C) specifying the VOC content as “pounds of\nvolatile organic compounds per gallon of solids” will not be included for Bexar County\nprovisions because the limits in the existing Table 2 are considered equivalent to existing\nTable 1, and because coating manufacturers typically do not specify VOC content in this\nmanner on their documentation.\nThe proposed new Bexar County provisions would establish VOC content limits mirroring\nthe limits in DFW and HGB, except for several coating categories as follows: one-component\nprefabricated architectural coatings (air-dried) VOC content limit would be 2.3 lbs/gal;\nmulti-component prefabricated architectural coatings (air-dried) VOC content limit would be\n2.8 lbs/gal; high-performance architectural coatings (air-dried) VOC content limit 3.5 lbs/gal;\nhigh-performance architectural coatings (baked) VOC content limit would 3.5 lbs/gal;\nextreme high-gloss coatings (air-dried) VOC content limit would be 2.8 lbs/gal; and one-\ncomponent general coatings (air-dried) VOC content limit would be 2.3 lbs/gal. The\nproposed metal parts and products coatings VOC content limits, in lbs/gal coating, are\nbased on the SCAQMD Rule 1107, adopted on January 6, 2006, and approved by EPA on\nNovember 24, 2008, as documented in the Federal Register (73 FR 70883). This rule has been\nsuccessfully used in California to reduce VOC emissions from metal parts and products, and\nemissions reductions achieved based on these limits in Bexar County are necessary to meet\nRFP requirements.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 28\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nThe commission proposes to add new VOC content limits for architectural coatings in the\nBexar County area. The new VOC content limits are currently used in other states. The new\nlimits are listed in proposed renumbered §115.453(a)(5). Emissions reductions achieved\nbased on these limits in Bexar County are necessary to meet RFP requirements The\ncommission currently has no VOC content limits for architectural coatings in the Bexar\nCounty area or other areas of Texas. Three new tables would be created in §115.453(a)(5)\nthat would list VOC content limits for various categories of architectural coatings, including\nbond breakers, building envelope coatings, concrete-curing compounds for roadways and\nbridges, concrete surface retarder, default coatings, driveway sealer, dry-fog coatings, faux\nfinishing coatings, fire-resistive coatings, flat and nonflat coatings, floor coatings, form\nrelease compound, graphic arts (sign) coatings, magnesite cement coatings, mastic coatings,\nmetallic pigmented coatings, multi-color coatings, pre-treatment wash primers, primers,\nsealers, and undercoaters, reactive penetrating sealers, recycled coatings, roof coatings,\nbituminous roof primers, rust preventative coatings, sacrificial, anti-graffiti coatings,\nshellacs, specialty primers, stains, stone consolidants, swimming pool coatings, tile and\nstone sealers, tub and tile refinishing coatings, waterproofing concrete/masonry sealers,\nwood coatings, conditioners, and preservatives, low-solids coatings, and certain colorants\nadded to architectural coatings. Compliance would be achieved through the application of\nlow VOC coatings. Applicable requirements for coating systems outlined in existing\n§115.453(c) and applicable work practice requirements detailed in existing §115.453(d)\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 29\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nwould apply and are not proposed for revision. The provision and equation in existing\n§115.453(a)(5) would be renumbered as §115.453(a)(6), with no additional proposed\nchanges.\nThe commission proposes to add new subsection §115.453(j) to implement control\nmeasures for industrial maintenance coatings in the Bexar County area. The new §115.453(j)\nindustrial maintenance coatings control requirement would set a VOC content limit of 2.1\nlbs/gal or 250 (g/l) of coating, excluding water and exempt solvents to be met by applying\nlow-VOC coatings. The limits of 2.1 lbs/gal and 250 g/l are considered equivalent. There is\ncurrently no VOC content limit control requirement for industrial maintenance coatings in\nthe Bexar County area. This measure would establish control requirements for industrial\nmaintenance coatings in the Bexar County area similar to contingency measures that exist in\n§115.453(f) and §115.453(g) for the DFW and HGB areas, respectively. This measure is\nnecessary in the Bexar County area to meet RFP requirements.\n§115.455 Approved Test Methods and Testing Requirements\nThe commission proposes to update approved test methods and testing requirements in\n§115.455 for architectural coating operations in the Bexar County area. Inclusion of these\nupdates in the proposed rule is necessary because new architectural coatings definitions\nmake references to them. The commission proposes to add American National Standards\nInstitute (ANSI) A137.1 Standard Specifications for Ceramic Tiles, a test method for\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 30\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\napplicable tile and stone penetrative sealers, and is referenced in proposed\n§115.450(c)(11)(VV)(i)(II). The commission proposes to reference The National Cooperative\nHighway Research Report 244 (1981) \"Concrete Sealers for the Protection of Bridge\nStructures\" test method for applicable surface chloride screening applications, and would be\nreferenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(HH)(vi). The commission proposes to update the\nexisting ASTM test methods list in §115.455(a)(1)(B) to include references to test methods\nC67, C97/97M, C140, C309 Class B, C373, C642, D523, D714, D3359, D3363, D4060, D4214,\nD4585, D6490, E96/E96M, E284, E331, E2167, and E2178 since they are included in various\nproposed definitions throughout §115.450. Proposed §115.450(c)(4)(A), §115.450(c)(5)(A),\nand §115.450(c)(6)(H), would require use of test method ASTM D523, that extreme high-\ngloss coatings have a reflectance of 75% or more on a 60 degree meter. Proposed\n§115.450(c)(9)(F) would require test method ASTM D523 to show a reflectance of at least\n85% on a 60 degree meter for high gloss coatings. Test method ASTM E2178 outlines the\ntesting methodology for building envelope coatings to have air barriers with a permeance\nnot exceeding 0.004 cubic feet per minute per square foot under a pressure differential of\n1.57 pounds per square foot and is referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(H)(i). Test\nmethod ASTM E331 is used to measure water resistance of building envelope coatings with\nwater resistive barriers and is referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(H)(ii)(I). The\ncommission proposes to add the definition of \"gonioapparent\" in §115.450(c)(11)(S).\nGonioapparent is a term that is used to describe decorative coatings, for which VOC content\nlimits are proposed. Test method ASTM E284 is used to measure the change in appearance\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 31\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nwith the change in the angle of illumination or angle of view of gonioapparent coatings. Test\nmethods ASTM C67, C97/97M, or C140 would be used to verify an improvement in water\nrepellency of at least 80% after application for reactive penetrating sealers and is referenced\nin proposed §115.450(c)(11)(HH)(iv). Test methods ASTM E96/E96M and ASTM D6490 are\nused to verify the ability of reactive penetrating sealers to provide a breathable waterproof\nbarrier for concrete or masonry surfaces that does not prevent or substantially retard water\nvapor transmission and are referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(HH)(v). Test method\nASTM D4214 defines an excessively chalky surface for the application of proposed specialty\nprimers to condition such surfaces and is referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(QQ). Test\nmethod ASTM E2167 specifies the proper use and specifications for proposed stone\nconsolidants, and is referenced in proposed 115.450(c)(11)(TT)(iii). Test methods ASTM\nC373, C97/97M, or C642 are used to demonstrate absorption as low as 0.10% for\npenetrating tile and stone sealers and are referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(VV)(i)(I).\nTest method ASTM D4060 is used to demonstrate that a proposed tub and tile refinishing\ncoating has a weight loss of 20 milligrams or less after 1,000 cycles as determined with CS-\n17 wheels on bonderite 1,000, as referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(XX)(ii). Test\nmethods ASTM D4585 and D714 are used to demonstrate a tub and tile refinishing coatings’\nability to withstand 1,000 hours or more of exposure with few or no #8 blisters, determined\non unscribed bonderite and are referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(XX)(iii). Test\nmethods ASTM D3359 and D4585 are used to show a tube and tile refinishing coatings’\nadhesion rating as 4B or better after 24 hours of recovery as determined on unscribed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 32\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nbonderite, as referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(XX)(iv). Test method ASTM D3363 is\nused to demonstrate a scratch hardness of 3H or harder and a gouge hardness of 4H or\nharder as determined on bonderite 1000, as referenced in proposed §115.450(c)(11)(XX)(i).\n§115.458 Monitoring and Recordkeeping Requirements\nThe commission proposes to add recordkeeping requirements for the newly proposed\narchitectural coating and industrial maintenance coating provisions for the Bexar County\narea. The commission is proposing to add a recordkeeping requirement for the newly\nproposed §115.453(j) industrial maintenance coating VOC limits and replace \"or\" with \"and\"\nin the last sentence of existing §115.458(b)(1), clarifying that records must be kept\ndocumenting compliance with all applicable §115.453 surface coating VOC control limits. By\nadding proposed new VOC content limits in §115.453(j) applicable in Bexar County, the “or”\nmust be changed to “and” since applicable requirements would exist in §115.453(a) and (j)\nfor some owners or operators in Bexar County. Owners or operators of architectural coating\nand industrial maintenance operations in the Bexar County area would be required to\nmaintain records of solvent information such as VOC content, composition, solids content,\nand solvent density. Because the rule language requires records for all applicable VOC\ncontent limits, no owners or operators in the DFW or HGB areas would be required to\nmaintain records of the industrial maintenance coating VOC content specified in proposed\n§115.453(j) since these coating limits would not be applicable in these areas. If, however, the\ncontingency measures for industrial maintenance coating VOC content limits in existing\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 33\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.453(f) or (g) are triggered according to §115.459(e) or (g), respectively, affected owners\nor operators would be required to maintain such records because the industrial\nmaintenance coating contingency VOC content limits would be applicable to them.\nMaintaining records of this information provides evidence that coatings and solvents\ncomply with VOC content limits.\n§115.459 Compliance Schedules\nTo provide owners and operators of metal parts and products coatings operations,\narchitectural coating operations, and industrial maintenance surface coating operations in\nthe Bexar County area with sufficient time to comply with new rule requirements, the\ncommission is proposing to establish a compliance date of March 1, 2026, under\n§115.459(c). This deadline ensures that facilities can adjust operations and implement\nnecessary changes while ensuring that the required VOC emission reductions needed for\nRFP are achieved during the attainment year.\nDIVISION 6: INDUSTRIAL CLEANING SOLVENTS\nRevisions in this division are proposed to generate VOC reductions for RFP requirements.\n§115.460 Applicability and Definitions\nThe commission proposes to amend the definition of \"electrical and electronic components\"\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 34\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nin §115.460(b)(7) for purposes of clarifying the Bexar County §115.461(f) exemption and\n§115.463(f) control requirements for the Bexar County area. The definition is different in\nthe context of different rule provisions, and this amendment would ensure that the proper\ndefinition applies in the context of §115.461(f) and §115.463(f) requirements. The\ncommission also proposes to amend the definition of \"solvent cleaning operation\" in\n§115.460(b)(42) for the Bexar County area §115.461(f) exemption and §115.463(f) control\nrequirement.\n§115.461 Exemptions\nThe commission proposes to relocate the existing §115.461(f) exemption to §115.461(g) and\ninsert newly proposed §115.461(f) language that would prohibit the use of existing\nexemptions §115.461(a) through (d) in Bexar County beginning March 1, 2026. The proposed\nlanguage would also update references to include the proposed renumbered §115.461(g). If\nadopted, newly proposed §115.461(f) would limit industrial solvent cleaning exemptions in\nBexar County to the following twelve categories: 1) cleaning of solar cells, laser hardware,\nscientific instruments, and high-precision optics; 2) cleaning conducted with performance\nlaboratory tests, coatings, adhesives, or inks; research and development programs; and\nlaboratory tests in quality assurance laboratories; 3) cleaning of paper-based gaskets, and\nclutch assemblies where rubber is bonded to metal by means of an adhesive; 4) cleaning of\ncotton swabs to remove cottonseed oil before cleaning of high-precision optics; 5) medical\ndevice and pharmaceutical facilities using up to 1.5 gallons per day of solvents; 6) the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 35\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\ncleaning of photocurable resins from stereolithography equipment and models; 7) cleaning\nof adhesive application equipment used for thin metal laminating operations provided the\nclean-up solvent used contains no more than 950 grams of VOC per liter; 8) cleaning of\nelectronic or electrical cables provided the clean-up solvent used contains no more than 400\ngrams of VOC per liter; 9) touch up cleaning performed on printed circuit boards where\nsurface mounted devices have already been attached provided that the solvent used\ncontains no more than 800 grams of VOC per liter; 10) cleaning carried out in batch loaded\ncold cleaners, vapor degreasers, conveyorized degreasers, or motion picture film cleaning\nequipment; 11) janitorial cleaning, including graffiti removal; and 12) stripping of cured\ncoatings, cured ink, or cured adhesives. The commission also proposes to add \"and (g) \" at\nthe end of §115.461(a) to clarify that both industrial solvent activities listed in (f) and\ncleaning solvents in aerosol cans referenced in (g) of this section are exempt and not\nrequired to be quantified. The list of exemptions proposed for Bexar County mirror those in\n§115.461(e) available in the DFW and HGB areas if the industrial cleaning solvent\ncontingency measures are triggered in those areas.\n§115.463 Control Requirements\nThe commission proposes to add new VOC content limits for industrial cleaning solvent\noperations in §115.463(f) for the Bexar County area. The industrial cleaning solvent\ncategories that would be subject include product cleaning during manufacturing processes\nor surface preparations for coating, adhesives, or ink applications; repair and maintenance\ncleaning; cleaning of coatings or adhesives application equipment; cleaning of ink\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 36\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\napplication equipment; and cleaning of polyester resin application equipment. This measure\nis projected to reduce VOC emissions from industrial cleaning solvent operations in the\nBexar County area and would align control requirements with the contingency measures in\nDFW and HGB by mirroring the requirements in §115.463(e). The commission also proposes\nto update the first sentence of §115.463(a) to clarify that sources in the DFW and HGB areas\nare not subject to §115.463(f), which only apply in the Bexar County area.\n§115.465 Approved Test Methods and Testing Requirements\nThe commission proposes to amend §115.465(1) to specify testing requirements that could\nbe used to verify the new VOC content limits proposed in §115.463(f). Existing testing\nmethods, specified in §115.465(1)(A) through (D), could be used to verify the proposed\nlimits in §115.463(f).\n§115.468 Monitoring and Recordkeeping Requirements\nThe commission proposes to amend §115.468(b)(1) to add recordkeeping requirements for\nthe newly proposed solvent cleaning provisions in the Bexar County area. The proposed\namendment to §115.468(b)(1) would require owners and operators of solvent cleaning\noperations to maintain records documenting compliance with newly proposed §115.463(f)\nVOC limits. Records demonstrating compliance include testing data, MSDSs, or\ndocumentation of the standard reference texts used to determine the true vapor pressure of\neach VOC component.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 37\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n§115.469 Compliance Schedules\nThe commission proposes an update to §115.469(b) to clarify that sources in the Bexar\nCounty area subject to the new Subchapter E, Division 6 industrial cleaning solvent\nrequirements must be in compliance no later than March 1, 2026. This provides sufficient\ntime for affected entities to implement compliant cleaning options while reducing VOC\nemissions prior to the ozone season of the attainment year.\nFiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government\nKyle Girten, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the first\nfive-year period the proposed rules are in effect, no significant fiscal implications are\nanticipated for TCEQ or other state government entities during implementation of the\nproposed rule.\nFiscal implications are anticipated for one city government entity during implementation of\nthe proposed rule. It is estimated that new gasoline dispensing nozzles and low\npermeability hoses would need to be installed at 11 city refueling stations to comply with\nthe proposed addition of Subchapter C, Division 6. Total costs as needed to replace all\ngasoline nozzles and gasoline dispensing hoses with low permeability hoses is estimated at\n$70,000 in year one. It is estimated that there would be savings of approximately $4,000\neach year in years two through five because gasoline leakage would reduce with the new\nhoses.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 38\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nPublic Benefits and Costs\nMr. Girten determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are in\neffect, the public benefit anticipated will be compliance with federal law and continued\nprotection of the environment and public health and safety combined with efficient and fair\nadministration of VOC emission standards for Bexar County. Corrections of errors and other\nnon-substantive changes within the rule would also benefit the public.\nCosts would be incurred for affected businesses operating in Bexar County for\nimplementation of requirements appliable to RACT. This rulemaking would lower the major\nsource threshold from 100 tpy to 50 tpy VOC for lithographic printing operations\n(Subchapter E, Division 4), bakery ovens (Subchapter B, Division 2), and VOC storage tanks\n(Subchapter B, Division 1). Additionally, to meet the required RFP reduction target, revisions\nwould be made as needed to implement stricter VOC limits for degreasing processes\n(Subchapter E, Division 1), fabric coating (Subchapter E, Division 2), coating of metal parts,\narchitectural coatings, and industrial maintenance coatings (Subchapter E, Division 5),\nindustrial cleaning solvent provisions (Subchapter E, Division 6), and gasoline dispensing\nnozzles and low permeation hoses from motor vehicle dispensing facilities (Subchapter C,\nDivision 6). Any impacted business may be required to update their permit with TCEQ to\nupdate processes that are approved for use at their facilities, and some costs may be\nincurred to meet these permitting requirements. Costs specific to affected businesses are\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 39\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\ndiscussed below.\nIt is estimated that there are 37 commercial bakeries, 61 lithographic printing facilities, and\n25 facilities with VOC storage tanks that would be affected by this rulemaking. Because the\nindividuals who are responsible for the sources should have implemented RACT measures\nafter the updates to this Chapter were made on April 24, 2024 (Rule Project No. 2023-116-\n115-AI), it is not anticipated that any additional costs would be incurred for these\nbusinesses. Should any commercial bakeries need to implement RACT measures, the cost\nper bakery is estimated at $492,000 in year one and $74,000 in years two through five, and\nthis includes costs related to incinerator control, monitoring, testing, and recordkeeping.\nShould any lithographic printing facilities need to implement RACT measures, the cost per\nfacility is estimated at $22,000 each year as needed to meet control and recordkeeping\nrequirements. Should RACT measures need implemented for VOC storage tanks, the cost\nper tanks is estimated at $150,280 in the year one and $22,100 in years two through five as\nneeded to meet control, monitoring, testing, seal inspection, and recordkeeping\nrequirements.\nThe remaining businesses that would be affected are nonpoint area sources. It is estimated\nthat there are eight facilities with degreasing processes, 25 facilities with fabric coating\nprocesses, 23 facilities with metal parts and products, five facilities with architectural\ncoating processes, 98 facilities that use industrial maintenance coatings, 98 facilities that\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 40\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nuse industrial cleaning solvents, and up to 1,181 retail gas stations that would incur costs.\nDegreasing requirements (Subchapter E, Division 1) would apply to owners or operators of\ncold solvent cleaning, open-top vapor degreasing, and conveyorized decreasing processes.\nTotal costs, as needed to meet lower VOC content requirements for degreasing materials,\nand associated recordkeeping, reporting, monitoring, or testing requirements is estimated to\ntotal approximately $270,000 in year one and $50,000 in years two through five.\nFabric coating requirements (Subchapter E, Division 2) would apply to fabric coating and\nwash primers. Total costs, as needed to meet lower VOC content requirements, and\nassociated recordkeeping, reporting, monitoring, or testing requirements is estimated to\ntotal approximately $1.3 million each year of the first five years the proposed rules are in\neffect.\nMetal parts, architectural coatings, and industrial maintenance coatings (Subchapter E,\nDivision 5) would apply to coating processes. For metal parts, total costs as needed to meet\nlower VOC content requirements, and associated recordkeeping, reporting, monitoring, or\ntesting requirements is $3.9 million each year of the first five years the proposed rules are\nin effect. For architectural coatings, costs to meet lower VOC content requirements, and\nassociated recordkeeping, reporting, monitoring, or testing requirements similarly totals\n$3.9 million each year. No additional expenses are anticipated for businesses that use\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 41\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nindustrial maintenance coatings because recordkeeping for current materials is assumed to\nbe done already. For the same reason, businesses that use industrial cleaning solvents\n(Subchapter E, Division 6) are not anticipated to incur any additional expenses.\nRequirements related to gas stations (Subchapter C, Division 6) would apply to all retail gas\nstations in Bexar County. Assuming 670 gas stations are impacted, the total costs as needed\nto replace all gasoline nozzles and replace gasoline dispensing hoses with low permeability\nhoses is $4.3 million in year one. It is estimated that there would be savings of over\n$230,000 each year in years two through five because gasoline leakage would reduce with\nthe new hoses.\nLocal Employment Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Local\nEmployment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking is not\nanticipated to adversely affect a local economy in a significant way for the first five years\nthat the proposed rule is in effect.\nRural Communities Impact Assessment\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first five\nyears that the proposed rules are in effect. This rulemaking applies to Bexar County, which\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 42\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nhas a large population; therefore, rural communities are not significantly impacted. Some\ncommercial bakeries, VOC storage tanks, degreasing operations, surface coating operations,\nand gasoline stations in rural communities would be impacted, but no adverse impacts to\nthese communities are anticipated.\nSmall Business and Micro-Business Assessment\nNo significant adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro-businesses due\nto the implementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period\nthe proposed rules are in effect. It is estimated there are seven commercial bakeries that are\nsmall businesses (four of which are micro-businesses), 61 lithographic printing facilities (53\nof which are micro-businesses), 18 VOC storage tanks (all of which are micro-businesses), 11\nsmall businesses that use fabric coating processes (all of which are micro-businesses), eight\nsmall businesses that use metal parts and product coatings (all of which are micro-\nbusinesses), 98 small businesses that use industrial maintenance coatings (88 of which are\nmicro-businesses), and 590 gasoline stations (541 of which are micro-businesses).\nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Small Business\nRegulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does not adversely\naffect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years the proposed rules\nare in effect. The proposed rules are required to represent RACT requirements that are\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 43\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\ntechnologically and economically feasible for regulated sources. The same compliance and\nreporting requirements are necessary and apply to all businesses regardless of size.\nGovernment Growth Impact Statement\nThe commission prepared a Government Growth Impact Statement assessment for this\nproposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a government\nprogram and will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative appropriations to\nthe agency. The proposed rulemaking does not require the creation of new employee\npositions, eliminate current employee positions, nor require an increase or decrease in fees\npaid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking amends an existing regulation, and it does not\nincrease or decrease the number of individuals subject to its applicability. During the first\nfive years, the proposed rule should not impact positively or negatively the state’s economy.\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking in light of the regulatory impact\nanalysis requirements of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225, and determined that the\nproposed rulemaking does not meet the definition of a major environmental rule as defined\nin that statute, and in addition, if it did meet the definition, would not be subject to the\nrequirement to prepare a regulatory impact analysis. A major environmental rule means a\nrule, the specific intent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risks to human\nhealth from environmental exposure, and that may adversely affect in a material way the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 44\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\neconomy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the\npublic health and safety of the state or a sector of the state. Additionally, the proposed\nrulemaking does not meet any of the four applicability criteria for requiring a regulatory\nimpact analysis for a major environmental rule, which are listed in Tex. Gov’t Code Ann.,\n§2001.0225(a). Section 2001.0225 of the Texas Government Code applies only to a major\nenvironmental rule, the result of which is to: 1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless\nthe rule is specifically required by state law; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law,\nunless the rule is specifically required by federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a\ndelegation agreement or contract between the state and an agency or representative of the\nfederal government to implement a state and federal program; or 4) adopt a rule solely\nunder the general powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law.\nThe specific intent of these proposed rules is to comply with federal requirements for the\nimplementation of control strategies necessary to attain and maintain the NAAQS for ozone\nmandated by 42 United States Code (USC), 7410, FCAA, §110, and required to be included in\noperating permits by 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA, §502, as specified elsewhere in this preamble.\nThe proposed rulemaking addresses RACT and RFP requirements for the Bexar County 2015\neight-hour ozone nonattainment area as discussed elsewhere in this preamble. States are\nrequired to adopt SIPs with enforceable emission limitations and other control measures,\nmeans, or techniques, as well as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may be\nnecessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of the FCAA. As discussed in\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 45\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nthe FISCAL NOTE portion of this preamble, the proposed rules are not anticipated to add\nany significant additional costs to affected individuals or businesses beyond what is\nnecessary to attain the ozone NAAQS on the economy, a sector of the economy,\nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the state\nor a sector of the state.\nIf a state does not comply with its obligations under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110 to submit\nSIPs, states are subject to discretionary sanctions under 42 USC, §7410(m) or mandatory\nsanctions under 42 USC, §7509, FCAA, §179; as well as the imposition of a federal\nimplementation plan (FIP) under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110(c). Under 42 USC, §7661a,\nFCAA, §502, states are required to have federal operating permit programs that provide\nauthority to issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable standard, regulation,\nor requirement under the FCAA, including enforceable emission limitations and other\ncontrol measures, means, or techniques, which are required under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA,\n§110. Similar to requirements in 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110, states are not free to ignore\nrequirements in 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA, §502 and must develop and submit programs to\nprovide for operating permits for major sources that include all applicable requirements of\nthe FCAA. Lastly, states are also subject to the imposition of sanctions under 42 USC,\n§7661a(d) and (i), FCAA, §502(d) and (i) for failure to submit an operating permits program,\nthe disapproval of any operating permits program, or failure to adequately administer and\nenforce the approved operating permits program.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 46\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nThe requirement to provide a fiscal analysis of regulations in the Texas Government Code\nwas amended by Senate Bill (SB) 633 during the 75th legislative session in 1997. The intent\nof SB 633 was to require agencies to conduct a regulatory impact analysis of extraordinary\nrules. These are identified in the statutory language as major environmental rules that will\nhave a material adverse impact and will exceed a requirement of state law, federal law, or a\ndelegated federal program, or are adopted solely under the general powers of the agency.\nWith the understanding that this requirement would seldom apply, the commission\nprovided a cost estimate for SB 633 that concluded \"based on an assessment of rules\nadopted by the agency in the past, it is not anticipated that the bill will have significant\nfiscal implications for the agency due to its limited application.\" The commission also noted\nthat the number of rules that would require assessment under the provisions of the bill was\nnot large. This conclusion was based, in part, on the criteria set forth in the bill that\nexempted rules from the full analysis unless the rule was a major environmental rule that\nexceeds a federal law. Because of the ongoing need to meet federal requirements, the\ncommission routinely proposes and adopts rules incorporating or designed to satisfy\nspecific federal requirements. The legislature is presumed to understand this federal\nscheme. If each rule proposed by the commission to meet a federal requirement was\nconsidered to be a major environmental rule that exceeds federal law, then each of those\nrules would require the full regulatory impact analysis (RIA) contemplated by SB 633.\nRequiring a full RIA for all federally required rules is inconsistent with the conclusions\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 47\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nreached by the commission in its cost estimate and by the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) in\nits fiscal notes. Since the legislature is presumed to understand the fiscal impacts of the\nbills it passes, and that presumption is based on information provided by state agencies and\nthe LBB, the that the intent of SB 633 was only to require the full RIA for rules that are\nextraordinary in nature. While the proposed rules may have a broad impact, that impact is\nno greater than is necessary or appropriate to meet the requirements of the FCAA, and in\nfact creates no additional impacts since the proposed rules do not impose burdens greater\nthan required to demonstrate attainment of the ozone NAAQS as discussed elsewhere in\nthis preamble. For these reasons, the proposed rules fall under the exception in Texas\nGovernment Code, §2001.0225(a), because they are required by, and do not exceed, federal\nlaw.\nThe commission has consistently applied this construction to its rules since this statute was\nenacted in 1997. Since that time, the legislature has revised the Texas Government Code, but\nleft this provision substantially unamended. It is presumed that \"when an agency\ninterpretation is in effect at the time the legislature amends the laws without making\nsubstantial change in the statute, the legislature is deemed to have accepted the agency’s\ninterpretation.\" (Central Power & Light Co. v. Sharp, 919 S.W.2d 485, 489 (Tex. App. Austin\n1995), writ denied with per curiam opinion respecting another issue, 960 S.W.2d 617 (Tex.\n1997); Bullock v. Marathon Oil Co., 798 S.W.2d 353, 357 (Tex. App. Austin 1990, no writ). Cf.\nHumble Oil & Refining Co. v. Calvert, 414 S.W.2d 172 (Tex. 1967); Dudney v. State Farm Mut.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 48\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nAuto Ins. Co., 9 S.W.3d 884, 893 (Tex. App. Austin 2000); Southwestern Life Ins. Co. v.\nMontemayor, 24 S.W.3d 581 (Tex. App. Austin 2000, pet. denied); and Coastal Indust. Water\nAuth. v. Trinity Portland Cement Div., 563 S.W.2d 916 (Tex. 1978).) The commission’s\ninterpretation of the RIA requirements is also supported by a change made to the Texas\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA) by the legislature in 1999. In an attempt to limit the\nnumber of rule challenges based upon APA requirements, the legislature clarified that state\nagencies are required to meet these sections of the APA against the standard of \"substantial\ncompliance\" (Texas Government Code, §2001.035). The legislature specifically identified\nTexas Government Code, §2001.0225 as falling under this standard.\nAs discussed in this analysis and elsewhere in this preamble, the commission has\nsubstantially complied with the requirements of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225. The\nproposed rulemaking implements the requirements of the FCAA as discussed in this\nanalysis and elsewhere in this preamble. The proposed rules were determined to be\nnecessary to attain the ozone NAAQS and are required to be included in permits under 42\nUSC, §7661a, FCAA, §502 and will not exceed any standard set by state or federal law. These\nproposed rules are not an express requirement of state law. The proposed rules do not\nexceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or a contract between state and federal\ngovernment, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the commission and approved by EPA, will\nbecome federal law as part of the approved SIP required by 42 U.S.C. §7410, FCAA, §110.\nThe proposed rules were not developed solely under the general powers of the agency but\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 49\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nare authorized by specific sections of Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 382 (also\nknown as the Texas Clean Air Act), and the Texas Water Code, which are cited in the\nStatutory Authority section of this preamble, including Texas Health and Safety Code,\n§§382.011, 382.012, and 382.017. Therefore, this proposed rulemaking action is not subject\nto the regulatory analysis provisions of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225(b).\nThe commission invites public comment regarding the Draft RIA Determination during the\npublic comment period. Written comments on the Draft RIA Determination may be\nsubmitted to the contact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments\nsection of this preamble.\nTakings Impact Assessment\nUnder Texas Government Code, §2007.002(5), taking means a governmental action that\naffects private real property, in whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a manner\nthat requires the governmental entity to compensate the private real property owner as\nprovided by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or §17\nor §19, Article I, Texas Constitution; or a governmental action that affects an owner’s\nprivate real property that is the subject of the governmental action, in whole or in part or\ntemporarily or permanently, in a manner that restricts or limits the owner’s right to the\nproperty that would otherwise exist in the absence of the governmental action; and is the\nproducing cause of a reduction of at least 25% in the market value of the affected private\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 50\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nreal property, determined by comparing the market value of the property as if the\ngovernmental action is not in effect and the market value of the property determined as if\nthe governmental action is in effect. The commission completed a takings impact analysis\nfor the proposed rulemaking action under the Texas Government Code, §2007.043.\nThe primary purpose of this proposed rulemaking action, as discussed elsewhere in this\npreamble, is to meet federal requirements for the implementation of control strategies\nnecessary to attain and maintain the NAAQS for ozone mandated by 42 United States Code\n(USC), 7410, FCAA, §110, and required to be included in operating permits by 42 USC,\n§7661a, FCAA, §502. The proposed rulemaking addresses VOC RACT and RFP requirements\nfor the Bexar County 2015 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area as discussed elsewhere in\nthis preamble.\nStates are required to adopt SIPs with enforceable emission limitations and other control\nmeasures, means, or techniques, as well as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may\nbe necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of the FCAA. If a state does\nnot comply with its obligations under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110 to submit SIPs, states are\nsubject to discretionary sanctions under 42 USC, §7410(m) or mandatory sanctions under\n42 USC, §7509, FCAA, §179; as well as the imposition of a FIP under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA,\n§110(c). Under 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA, §502, states are required to have federal operating\npermit programs that provide authority to issue permits and assure compliance with each\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 51\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\napplicable standard, regulation, or requirement under the FCAA, including enforceable\nemission limitations and other control measures, means, or techniques, which are required\nunder 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110. Similar to requirements in 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110,\nregarding the requirement to adopt and implement plans to attain and maintain the national\nambient air quality standards, states are not free to ignore requirements in 42 USC, §7661a,\nFCAA, §502 and must develop and submit programs to provide for operating permits for\nmajor sources that include all applicable requirements of the FCAA. Lastly, states are also\nsubject to the imposition of sanctions under 42 USC, §7661a(d) and (i), FCAA, §502(d) and\n(i) for failure to submit an operating permits program, the disapproval of any operating\npermits program, or failure to adequately administer and enforce the approved operating\npermits program.\nThe proposed rules will not create any additional burden on private real property beyond\nwhat is required under federal law, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the commission and\napproved by EPA, will become federal law as part of the approved SIP required by 42 U.S.C.\n§7410, FCAA, §110. The proposed rules will not affect private real property in a manner\nthat would require compensation to private real property owners under the United States\nConstitution or the Texas Constitution. The proposal also will not affect private real\nproperty in a manner that restricts or limits an owner’s right to the property that would\notherwise exist in the absence of the governmental action. Therefore, the proposed\nrulemaking will not cause a taking under Texas Government Code, Chapter 2007.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 52\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nConsistency with the Coastal Management Program\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking and found the proposal is a rulemaking\nidentified in the Coastal Coordination Act Implementation Rules, 31 TAC §29.11(b)(2),\nrelating to rules subject to the Coastal Management Program, and will, therefore, require\nthat goals and policies of the Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP) be considered\nduring the rulemaking process.\nThe commission reviewed this rulemaking for consistency with the CMP goals and policies\nin accordance with the regulations of the Coastal Coordination Advisory Committee and\ndetermined that the rulemaking will not affect any coastal natural resource areas because\nthe rules only affect counties outside the CMP area and is, therefore, consistent with CMP\ngoals and policies.\nWritten comments on the consistency of this rulemaking may be submitted to the contact\nperson at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this preamble.\nEffect on Sites Subject to the Federal Operating Permits Program\nChapter 115 is an applicable requirement under 30 TAC Chapter 122, Federal Operating\nPermits Program. Once adopted, owners or operators of affected sites subject to the federal\noperating permit program must, consistent with the revision process in Chapter 122, upon\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 53\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nthe effective date of the rulemaking, revise their operating permit to include the new\nChapter 115 requirements.\nAnnouncement of Hearing\nThe commission will offer a public hearing on this proposal in San Antonio on August 19,\n2025, at 7:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time at the Alamo Area Council of Governments\n(AACOG) at 2700 NE Loop 410, Suite 101. The hearing is structured for the receipt of oral or\nwritten comments by interested persons. Individuals may present oral statements when\ncalled upon in order of registration.

These procedures are:\nProcedure T - Criteria for and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total Enclosure;\nProcedure L - VOC Input; Procedure G.2 - Captured VOC Emissions (Dilution Technique);\nProcedure F.1 - Fugitive VOC Emissions from Temporary Enclosures; and Procedure F.2 -\nFugitive VOC Emissions from Building Enclosures.\n(A) The following exemptions apply to capture efficiency testing\nrequirements.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 356\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n(i) If a source installs a permanent total enclosure that meets the\nspecifications of Procedure T and that directs all VOC to a control device, then the capture\nefficiency is assumed to be 100%, and the source is exempted from capture efficiency\ntesting requirements. This does not exempt the source from performance of any control\ndevice efficiency testing that may be required. In addition, a source must demonstrate all\ncriteria for a permanent total enclosure are met during testing for control efficiency.\n(ii) If a source uses a vapor control system designed to collect\nand recover VOC (e.g., carbon adsorption system), an explicit measurement of capture\nefficiency is not necessary if the following conditions are met. The overall control of the\nsystem can be determined by directly comparing the input liquid VOC to the recovered\nliquid VOC. The general procedure for use in this situation is given in 40 CFR §60.433 (as\namended through October 17, 2000 (65 FR 61761)), with the following additional\nrestrictions.\n(I) The source must be able to equate solvent usage with\nsolvent recovery on a 24-hour (daily) basis, rather than a 30-day weighted average. This\nverification must be done within 72 hours following each 24-hour period of the 30-day\nperiod.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 357\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n(II) The solvent recovery system (i.e., capture and control\nsystem) must be dedicated to a single process line (e.g., one process line venting to a carbon\nadsorber system) or if the solvent recovery system controls multiple process lines, the\nsource must be able to demonstrate that the overall control (i.e., the total recovered solvent\nVOC divided by the sum of liquid VOC input to all process lines venting to the control\nsystem) meets or exceeds the most stringent standard applicable for any process line\nventing to the control system.\n(B) The capture efficiency must be calculated using one of the following\nprotocols referenced. Any affected source must use one of these protocols, unless a suitable\nalternative protocol is approved by the executive director and the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n(i) Gas/gas method using temporary total enclosure (TTE). The\nEPA specifications to determine whether a temporary enclosure is considered a TTE are\ngiven in Procedure T. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is:\nFigure: 30 TAC §115.465(2)(B)(i) (No Change)\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 358\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n(ii) Liquid/gas method using TTE. The EPA specifications to\ndetermine whether a temporary enclosure is considered a TTE are given in Procedure T. The\ncapture efficiency equation to be used for this protocol is:\nFigure: 30 TAC §115.465(2)(B)(ii) (No Change)\n(iii) Gas/gas method using the building or room enclosure (BE) in\nwhich the affected source is located and in which the mass of VOC captured and delivered\nto a control device and the mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from the BE are measured\nwhile operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the BE must be operating\nas they would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this\nprotocol is:\nFigure: 30 TAC §115.465(2)(B)(iii) (No Change)\n(iv) Liquid/gas method using a BE in which the mass of liquid\nVOC input to process and the mass of fugitive VOC that escapes from the BE are measured\nwhile operating only the affected facility. All fans and blowers in the BE must be operated as\nthey would under normal production. The capture efficiency equation to be used for this\nprotocol is:\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 359\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\nFigure: 30 TAC §115.465(2)(B)(iv) (No Change)\n(C) The operating parameters selected for monitoring of the capture\nsystem for compliance with the requirements in §115.468(a) of this title (relating to\nMonitoring and Recordkeeping Requirements) must be monitored and recorded during the\ninitial capture efficiency testing and thereafter during facility operation. The executive\ndirector may require a new capture efficiency test if the operating parameter values change\nsignificantly from those recorded during the initial capture efficiency test.\n(3) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this section, the owner\nor operator shall determine compliance with §115.463(b) of this title by applying the\nfollowing test methods, as appropriate:\n(A) Methods 1 - 4 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A) for determining flow\nrates, as necessary;\n(B) Method 25 (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A) for determining total\ngaseous nonmethane organic emissions as carbon;\n(C) Method 25A or 25B (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A) for determining\ntotal gaseous organic concentrations using flame ionization or nondispersive infrared\nanalysis; and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 360\nChapter 115 – Control of Air Pollution From Volatile Organic Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-006-115-AI\n(D) additional performance test procedures described in 40 CFR §60.444\n(as amended through October 18, 1983 (48 FR 48375)).\n(4) Minor modifications to the methods in paragraphs (1) - (3) of this section\nmay be approved by the executive director. Methods other than those specified in\nparagraphs (1) - (3) of this section may be used if approved by the executive director and\nvalidated using Method 301 (40 CFR Part 63, Appendix A). For the purposes of this\nparagraph, substitute \"executive director\" each place that Method 301 references\n\"administrator.\"\n§115.468.

    "full_text": "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 1\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission)\nproposes amendments to §§117.10, 117.200, 117.203, 117.205, 117.230, 117.235,\n117.240, 117.245 and 117.9010.\nIf adopted, these rules would be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency (EPA) as a state implementation plan (SIP) revision.\nBackground and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules\nOn June 20, 2024, EPA published the final reclassification of the Bexar County 2015\neight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) nonattainment area\nfrom moderate to serious, effective July 22, 2024 (89 Federal Register (FR) 51829). The\nattainment date for Bexar County under the serious classification is September 24,\n2027, with a 2026 attainment year. TCEQ is required to submit serious classification\nattainment demonstration (AD) and reasonable further progress (RFP) SIP revisions to\nEPA by January 1, 2026, to comply with the serious ozone nonattainment area\nrequirements, as outlined in federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), §§172(c), 182(c), and 182(f)\nfor the Bexar County 2015 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area.\nNonattainment areas classified as moderate and above, including serious, are required\nto meet the mandates of the FCAA in §172(c)(1) and §182(c) and (f). FCAA, §172(c)(1)\nrequires that the SIP incorporate all reasonably available control measures (RACM),\nincluding reasonably available control technology (RACT), as expeditiously as\npracticable and to provide for attainment of the NAAQS. FCAA, §182(c) addresses the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nSIP requirements for demonstrating attainment and RFP for areas classified as serious.\nFCAA, §172(c) mandates that the commission submit an AD SIP revision to\ndemonstrate that the Bexar County area will meet the NAAQS by its attainment date.\nPhotochemical modeling for future years indicates that the Bexar County area will\nmeet the 2015 ozone NAAQS by the mandated deadline using existing control\nstrategies. The commission is neither required to propose nor is it proposing any\namendments to demonstrate attainment for the Bexar County area in this rulemaking\nbecause the AD modeling demonstrates attainment without the need for additional\nmeasures. A RACM analysis to identify additional potential control measures that\ncould expedite attainment of the NAAQS earlier than the area’s attainment date is\nprovided in the concurrently proposed Bexar County 2015 Ozone NAAQS Serious AD\nSIP Revision (Non-Rule Project No. 2024-041-SIP-NR). The RACM analysis determined\nthat no potential control measures met the criteria to be considered RACM. As a result,\nno rule revisions are proposed as RACM.\nFCAA, §182(f) requires the state to submit a SIP revision that implements RACT for all\nmajor sources of nitrogen oxides (NO ). EPA defines RACT as the lowest emission\nX\nlimitation that a particular source is capable of meeting by the application of control\ntechnology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic\nfeasibility (44 FR 53761, September 17, 1979). RACT requirements for moderate and\nhigher classification ozone nonattainment areas are included in the FCAA to ensure\nthat significant source categories at major sources of ozone precursor emissions are\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 3\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\ncontrolled to a reasonable extent, but not necessarily to best available control\ntechnology levels expected of new sources or to maximum achievable control\ntechnology levels required for major sources of hazardous air pollutants. Although the\nFCAA requires the state to implement RACT, EPA guidance provides states with the\nflexibility to determine the most technologically and economically feasible RACT\nrequirements for a nonattainment area. As currently defined in 30 Texas\nAdministrative Code (TAC) §117.10(29), a major source of NO is any stationary source\nx\nor group of sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that\nemits or has the potential to emit a specific amount of NO emissions based on the\nX\narea’s ozone nonattainment classification. For the Bexar County serious ozone\nnonattainment area, a major source of NO is any stationary source or group of\nX\nsources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has\nthe potential to emit at least 50 tons per year (tpy) of NO .\nX\nFor the reclassification to serious ozone nonattainment, TCEQ reviewed the 2022 point\nsource Emissions Inventory (EI) to identify all major sources of NO emissions in the\nX\nBexar County ozone nonattainment area. Since the point source EI database reports\nactual emissions rather than potential to emit, TCEQ reviewed sources that reported\nactual emissions as low as 10 tpy of NO to account for the difference between actual\nX\nand potential emissions. TCEQ also reviewed air permits to further confirm which sites\nwith low emissions in 2022 were major sources of NO due to authorized emissions of\nX\n50 or more tpy. Sites from the point source EI database with emissions of 10 tpy or\nmore of NO that could not be verified as minor sources by other means were included\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 4\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nin the RACT analysis. To evaluate what rules would be necessary to fulfill RACT\nrequirements, TCEQ considered other Chapter 117 rules that address other ozone\nnonattainment areas, rules in other states, and federal rules for the unit categories\nidentified at the major NO sources in the serious ozone nonattainment area. As part\nX\nof this proposed rulemaking, TCEQ determined that the proposed rule revisions for\nthe affected major NO sources located in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area\nX\nwould fulfill RACT requirements for those sources and be consistent with or more\nstringent than controls implemented in other ozone nonattainment areas within the\nstate and outside the state. Because the Bexar County 2015 eight-hour ozone NAAQS\nnonattainment area was previously classified as moderate, sources that emit or have\nthe potential to emit at least 100 tpy NO are already required to comply with Chapter\nX\n117 RACT rules. On April 24, 2024, the commission adopted NO RACT rules for\nX\nsources in Bexar County under the moderate classification in a Chapter 117\nrulemaking (Rule Project No. 2023-117-117-AI) that was part of the Bexar County 2015\nEight-Hour Ozone Standard Moderate Nonattainment Area RACT SIP Revision (Non-\nRule Project No. 2023-132-SIP-NR). This proposed rulemaking would extend\nimplementation of RACT to all major sources of NO in the area that emit or have the\nX\npotential to emit at least 50 tpy of NO .\nX\nAs required by FCAA, §172(c)(1) and §182(f), the proposed rulemaking would ensure\nthat all major sources of NO in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area are\nX\nsubject to RACT, either by being subject to requirements that meet or exceed the\napplicable RACT requirements, or by determining that further emission controls on the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 5\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nsources in the area are either not economically feasible or not technologically feasible.\nFederally approved state rules and rule approval dates can be found in 40 Code of\nFederal Regulations (CFR) §52.2270(c), EPA Approved Regulations in the Texas SIP.\nThe commission proposes to revise Chapter 117, Subchapter B, Division 2 to change\nthe requirements for major industrial, commercial, or institutional (ICI) sources of NO\nX\nin the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area to address NO RACT requirements for\nX\nserious ozone nonattainment areas. Proposed revisions would require some owners or\noperators of major ICI sources of NO in Bexar County to reduce NO emissions from\nX X\ncertain stationary sources and source categories for the serious ozone nonattainment\narea. The proposed rulemaking would extend rule applicability of Subchapter B,\nDivision 2 to stationary gas-fired engines fired on landfill gas, stationary diesel\nengines, ICI process heaters, natural gas-fired ovens, and incinerators. The proposed\nrulemaking would also include new emission standards for stationary gas-fired engines\nfired on landfill gas. Proposed rule revisions would further include new emission\nstandards and exemptions for stationary diesel engines, process heaters, and natural\ngas-fired ovens. Proposed rule revisions would also include new exemptions for\nincinerators. The proposed rulemaking would also extend applicability of existing\nmonitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements associated with\nDivision 2 to the newly affected major sources of NO located in the Bexar County\nX\nserious ozone nonattainment area. These monitoring, testing, recordkeeping, and\nreporting requirements would be necessary to ensure compliance with the new\nemission specifications, confirm eligibility for certain exemptions, and ensure that NO\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 6\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nemission reductions are achieved from the units that become subject to the\nrequirements of Chapter 117, Subchapter B, Division 2.\nSection by Section Discussion\nIn addition to the proposed amendments associated with implementing RACT for the\nBexar County ozone nonattainment area and specific minor clarifications and\ncorrections discussed in greater detail in this section, this proposed rulemaking also\nincludes various stylistic, non-substantive changes to update rule language to current\nTexas Register style and format requirements. Such changes include appropriate and\nconsistent use of acronyms, section references, rule structure, and certain terminology.\nThese changes are non-substantive and generally are not specifically discussed in this\npreamble.\nSubchapter A, Definitions\nSection 117.10, Definitions\nThe proposal would revise the definition of major source in §117.10(29)(B) to lower the\nmajor source threshold from 100 tpy to 50 tpy for NO for sources in the Bexar County\nX\nozone nonattainment area. The change is necessary to address the area’s\nreclassification to serious nonattainment for the 2015 eight-hour ozone NAAQS. Major\nsources affected by the proposed rulemaking would be required to comply with all\napplicable Chapter 117 rules by March 1, 2026, as stated in the rule compliance\nschedule in proposed revised §117.9010.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 7\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nThe proposed rulemaking would also expand the definition of unit in §117.10(51)(G) to\ninclude the list of units that would be covered under §117.205 concerning RACT\nemissions specifications in Bexar County. The proposed changes to §117.10(51)(G)\nwould add process heaters and any other stationary source of NO at a major source,\nX\nas defined in §117.10. The proposed changes to §117.10(51)(G) would also replace the\nterm “gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal combustion engine” with\nthe proposed new term “stationary internal combustion engine.” As with the existing\ndefinition for stationary internal combustion engine, the proposed changes to\n§117.10(51)(G) would specify that stationary gas-fired lean-burn engines remain\nsubject to the requirements of Subchapter B, Division 2 and that stationary diesel\nengines and stationary gas-fired engines fired on landfill gas would also become\nsubject to the requirements of Subchapter B, Division 2. Because the emission\nreductions required by the RACT provisions necessitate further reductions from\nadditional unit categories not previously covered, the proposed revisions broaden the\napplicability of the definition of unit to include any other stationary source of NO at a\nX\nmajor source, including those units that may qualify for a proposed exemption.\nSubchapter B, Combustion Control at Major Industrial, Commercial, and\nInstitutional Sources in Ozone Nonattainment Areas\nDivision 2, Bexar County Ozone Nonattainment Area Major Sources\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 8\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nSection 117.200, Applicability\nThe proposed rulemaking would expand the applicability of Subchapter B, Division 2\nto include additional unit categories under §117.200. Section 117.200 currently applies\nto stationary gas turbines, duct burners used in turbine exhaust ducts, and gas-fired\nlean-burn stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines located at a major\nsource of NO in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area. Proposed changes would\nX\nadd ICI process heaters and natural gas-fired ovens, flares, and incinerators to the list\nof applicable units. The term “gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal\ncombustion engines” in §117.200(3) is proposed to be replaced with the new term,\n“stationary internal combustion engines.” Considering that the existing definition of\nstationary internal combustion engines in §117.10(46) addresses any reciprocating\nengine that satisfies the time in residence requirement of the definition, revising\n§117.200(3) to apply to stationary internal combustion engines would cover not only\ngas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines, but also\nstationary diesel engines and stationary gas-fired engines fired on landfill gas. All\nknown diesel-fuel fired and gaseous-fuel fired stationary engines at major NO sources\nX\nin the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area that are not identified as stationary\nturbines are reciprocating internal combustion engines.\nThe commission proposes to add new paragraphs (4) through (7) in §117.200 to\nexpand applicability of the rule provisions of Subchapter B, Division 2 to ICI process\nheaters and natural gas-fired ovens, flares, and incinerators. These unit categories were\nidentified in the 2022 point source EI at NO major sources in the Bexar County ozone\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 9\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nnonattainment area.\nSection 117.203, Exemptions\nExisting §117.203 lists the units that are exempt from the provisions of Chapter 117,\nSubchapter B, Division 2. The commission notes that the existing rule provision\nreference to §117.245(f)(9) in §117.203 is an error. Section 117.245(f) currently does\nnot contain a paragraph (9). Therefore, the existing reference to §117.245(f)(9) in\n§117.203 is proposed to be deleted. Because the commission proposes a new\n§117.245(f)(7) to specify recordkeeping requirements concerning diesel engines and\noperating restrictions, the commission proposes a new rule provision reference to\nproposed new §117.245(f)(7) in §117.203. Because the commission further proposes a\nnew §117.205(e) to specify operating restrictions for owners or operators of stationary\ndiesel engines, the commission proposes a new rule provision reference to proposed\nnew §117.205(e) in §117.203.\nProposed revised paragraph (1) would replace the term gas-fired lean-burn stationary\nreciprocating internal combustion engines with the term stationary internal\ncombustion engines. This proposed change would coincide with the proposed change\nto §117.200(3) to list stationary internal combustion engines as applicable units\nsubject to the provisions of Subchapter B, Division 2. With this proposed change,\nowners or operators of gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal\ncombustion engines, stationary diesel engines, and stationary gas-fired engines fired\non landfill gas would be able to claim an exemption based on dedicated use. The\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 10\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nallowed dedicated uses eligible for an exemption are listed in subparagraphs (A)\nthrough (E) of paragraph (1).\nExisting §117.203(1)(D) provides for an exemption for owners or operators of\nstationary gas turbines and gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal\ncombustion engines that are used exclusively in emergency situations, as defined in\n§117.10(15), except that operation of the unit for testing or maintenance purposes of\nthe unit is allowed for up to 100 hours per year, on a rolling 12-month basis. For an\nowner or operator of a stationary diesel engine used exclusively in emergency\nsituations, as defined in §117.10(15), to claim this exemption, proposed revisions to\nsubparagraph (D) would specify that a stationary diesel engine would have to be placed\ninto service before March 1, 2026. The proposed change would make clear that any\nnew stationary diesel engine and any modified, reconstructed, or relocated existing\nstationary diesel engine placed into service on or after March 1, 2026, would be\nineligible for the exemption under proposed revised subparagraph (D). For the\npurposes of this exemption, the terms “modification” and “reconstruction” have the\nmeanings defined in 30 TAC §116.10 and 40 CFR §60.15 (December 16, 1975),\nrespectively, and the term “relocated” means to newly install at an account, as defined\nin 30 TAC §101.1, a used engine from anywhere outside that account.\nThis proposed change would mirror similar provisions in other parts of Chapter 117\nfor other ozone nonattainment areas for owners or operators of stationary diesel\nengines claiming an exemption based on dedicated emergency use. The proposed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 11\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nchange to subparagraph (D) provides owners or operators of existing stationary diesel\nengines that are used solely for emergency reasons the opportunity to continue to rely\non such units without having to modify an engine, install post-combustion controls, or\nreplace a unit to meet proposed NO emission specifications so long as the existing\nX\nunit is never modified or reconstructed, nor is an existing unit ever relocated from\noutside the area to a major source of NO in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment\nX\narea, on or after the proposed threshold date. These changes to the existing exemption\nare proposed due to the relatively small NO emissions contribution in the area from\nX\nthese sources due to their limited, dedicated use or the impracticality of using NO\nX\nemissions controls during such limited operating times. A threshold date is proposed\nin §117.203(1)(D) to ensure the net effect is that existing stationary diesel engines, if\nused exclusively in emergency situations and placed into service before the proposed\nthreshold date, would be exempt from the new emission specifications in proposed\nnew §117.205(a)(3)(B), whereas new, modified, reconstructed, or relocated stationary\ndiesel engines placed into service on or after March 1, 2026, would be required to be\ncleaner diesel engines. New, modified, reconstructed, or relocated stationary diesel\nengines placed into service on or after March 1, 2026, would be required to meet\nfederal Tier 4 emission standards for non-road diesel engines in effect at the time of\ninstallation, modification, reconstruction, or relocation. These proposed measures\nwould leverage the natural replacement cycle of equipment and ensure that as older\nstationary diesel engines reach the end of their operational life, and turnover of older,\nhigher-emitting stationary diesel engines occurs, the replacement units would be\ncleaner diesel engines. The gradual modernization of stationary diesel engines in the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 12\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nBexar County area would lead to consistent decreases in NO emissions, helping the\nX\narea comply with more stringent NAAQS.\nThe proposed changes to §117.203 would also add a new §117.203(2) to exempt\nexisting stationary diesel engines located at major sources of NO in the Bexar County\nX\nozone nonattainment area that are placed into service before March 1, 2026, and\noperate less than 100 hours per calendar year on a rolling 12-month basis. The\nproposed new §117.203(2) would not exempt any modified, reconstructed, or relocated\nstationary diesel engine placed into service on or after March 1, 2026. For the purposes\nof this exemption, the terms “modification” and “reconstruction” have the meanings\ndefined in 30 TAC §116.10 and 40 CFR §60.15 (December 16, 1975), respectively, and\nthe term “relocated” means to newly install at an account, as defined in 30 TAC\n§101.1, a used engine from anywhere outside that account. This exemption in\nproposed new §117.203(2) would be similar in effect to the proposed revisions to\n§117.203(1)(D) in that an owner or operator of an existing stationary diesel engine\ncould continue to operate the unit provided the unit would not be altered on or after\nthe rule compliance date. This would help to ensure that the same NO emissions\nx\nprofile from the existing unit could be expected in the future. This would also help to\nensure that all NO emissions from any existing unit already located in the\nX\nnonattainment area and any existing unit that may be moved into the area, thus\nconsidered new, are accounted for during SIP development. Based on reported\ninformation in the 2022 point source EI, the commission does not anticipate owners or\noperators of existing stationary diesel engines placed into service before the proposed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 13\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nthreshold date of March 1, 2026, would be unable to meet the proposed operating hour\nrequirement of less than 100 hours per calendar year based on a rolling 12-month\nbasis.\nThe proposed changes to §117.203 would further add a new §117.203(3) to exempt\nnew, modified, reconstructed, or relocated stationary diesel engines located at major\nsources of NO in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area if the new, modified,\nX\nreconstructed, or relocated stationary diesel engine is placed into service on or after\nMarch 1, 2026, operates less than 100 hours per calendar year on a rolling 12-month\nbasis and meets the corresponding NO emission standard for non-road engines listed\nX\nin 40 CFR §1039.101, Table 1 (effective July 29, 2021), and in effect at the time of\ninstallation, modification, reconstruction, or relocation. Operating time during\nemergency situations, as defined in §117.10(15), would be excluded from the limit on\noperating hours under proposed new §117.203(3). For the purposes of this exemption,\nthe terms “modification” and “reconstruction” have the meanings defined in 30 TAC\n§116.10 and 40 CFR §60.15 (December 16, 1975), respectively, and the term\n“relocated” means to newly install at an account, as defined in 30 TAC §101.1, a used\nengine from anywhere outside that account. Similar to the proposed revisions to\n§117.203(1)(D) and proposed new §117.203(2), owners or operators of existing units\ncould continue to operate their existing units as they previously had provided the units\nwould not be altered on or after the proposed threshold date of March 1, 2026.\nFurthermore, these and the other proposed new requirements for stationary diesel\nengines would ensure that as turnover of older, higher-emitting stationary diesel\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 14\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nengines occurs, the replacement units would be cleaner diesel engines.\nExisting paragraphs (2) and (3) in §117.203 are proposed to be renumbered to\nparagraphs (4) and (5), respectively. Existing paragraph (2), renumbered as paragraph\n(4), concerning exempt units, continues to apply to gas-fired lean-burn stationary\ninternal combustion engines rated less than 50 horsepower (hp) and fired on any type\nof gaseous fuel other than landfill gas. The commission also proposes to remove the\nword “reciprocating” from the term “gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating\ninternal combustion engines” in existing paragraph (2), renumbered as paragraph (4),\nbecause, for purposes of Chapter 117, the concept of a reciprocating engine is implied\nwith stationary engines as opposed to rotary engines. For purposes of Chapter 117,\nrotary engines are considered stationary turbines, and the existing definition for\nstationary internal combustion engine in §117.10 already includes the term\n“reciprocating.” Existing paragraph (3), renumbered as paragraph (5), concerning\nexempt units, continues to apply to stationary gas turbines with a maximum rated\ncapacity less than 10.0 million British thermal units per hour (MMBtu/hr). Existing\nparagraph (3), renumbered as paragraph (5), would further include the new acronym\n“MMBtu/hr” for “million British thermal units per hour.”\nThe commission proposes new §117.203(6) to specify that ICI process heaters with a\nmaximum rated capacity equal to or less than 5.0 MMBtu/hr are exempt from the\nprovisions of Subchapter B, Division 2. The commission identified nine process heaters\nin the 2022 point source EI, with all nine units located at the same major source of NO\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 15\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nin the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area. Because three units had reported heat\ninput equal to or less than 5.0 MMBtu/hr, the commission anticipates that these three\nunits would qualify for exemption from the proposed rulemaking. Because the\nremaining six units had reported heat inputs equal to or greater than the proposed\nexemption threshold of 5.0 MMBtu/hr, these six units are anticipated to require NO\nX\nemission reductions to meet the proposed NO emission specification requirements for\nX\nICI process heaters in proposed revised §117.205. This exemption level is proposed in\n§117.203 due to the relatively small contribution of NO emissions from units that are\nX\nequal to or less than 5.0 MMBtu/hr and the impracticality of installing and maintaining\nNO controls on such units for this proposed rulemaking.\nX\nThe proposed rulemaking would specify in new §117.203(7) that natural gas-fired\novens with a maximum rated capacity equal to or less than 5.0 MMBtu/hr are exempt\nfrom the provisions of Subchapter B, Division 2. The commission identified seven\novens in the 2022 point source EI, with all seven units located at the same major\nsource of NO in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area. Because three units had\nX\nreported heat input equal to or less than 5.0 MMBtu/hr, the commission anticipates\nthat these three units would qualify for exemption from the proposed rulemaking.\nBecause the remaining four units had reported heat inputs equal to or greater than the\nproposed exemption threshold of 5.0 MMBtu/hr, these four units are anticipated to\nrequire NO emission reductions to meet the proposed NO emission specification\nX X\nrequirements for natural gas-fired ovens in proposed revised §117.205. Similar to the\nexemption proposed for ICI process heaters, this exemption level for natural gas-fired\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 16\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\novens is proposed due to the relatively small contribution of NO emissions from units\nX\nthat are equal to or less than 5.0 MMBtu/hr and the impracticality of installing and\nmaintaining NO controls on such units for this proposed rulemaking.\nX\nProposed new §117.203(8) would add an exemption for flares from the provisions of\nSubchapter B, Division 2. Proposed new §117.203(9) would exempt incinerators with a\nmaximum rated capacity less than 40 MMBtu/hr from the provisions of Subchapter B,\nDivision 2. The proposed exemptions for these unit types located at major sources of\nNO in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area are consistent with existing\nX\nexemptions for the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) eight-hour ozone nonattainment area\nmajor sources, in existing §117.403(a)(3), and for the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria\n(HGB) ozone nonattainment area major sources, in existing §117.303(a)(4). The\ncommission identified four incinerators in the 2022 point source EI at major sources\nof NO in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area, with all four units expected to\nX\nqualify for exemption under proposed new §117.203(9). Existing §117.203(4) is\nproposed to be renumbered as §117.203(10).\nSection 117.205, Emission Specifications for Reasonably Available Control\nTechnology (RACT)\nThe commission proposes to revise §117.205(a)(3) as part of a broader effort to\ninclude additional types of stationary internal combustion engines located at major\nsources of NO . Currently, §117.205(a)(3) specifies NO emission limits for only gas-\nX X\nfired lean-burn engines not fired on landfill gas. The proposed revision would expand\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 17\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nthese specifications to include two additional engine types: gas-fired lean-burn engines\nfired on landfill gas and diesel engines. Proposed new §117.205(a)(3)(A)(i) would\nspecify that gas-fired lean-burn engines fired on landfill gas would be subject to a NO\nX\nemission standard of 0.60 grams per horsepower-hour (g/hp-hr). The landfill gas fired\nin these stationary engines is a byproduct of the decomposition of organic waste in a\nnearby municipal solid waste landfill, with methane composing much of the waste gas.\nThe proposed Bexar County NO emission specification for stationary engines that are\nX\nfired on landfill gas is based on the NO emission specification for similar units located\nX\nat NO major sources in the DFW eight-hour ozone nonattainment area,\nX\n§117.410(a)(4)(B)(ii)(I), and in the HGB ozone nonattainment area, §117.310(a)(9)(B)(i),\nrespectively. The proposed emission specification of 0.60 g/hp-hr in\n§117.205(a)(3)(A)(i) is expected to be achievable through combustion modifications.\nThe existing NO emission standard of 0.50 g/hp-hr in §117.205(a)(3), for gas-fired\nX\nlean-burn stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines, is proposed to be\nmoved to new §117.205(a)(3)(A)(ii).\nThe proposed changes to §117.205(a)(3) further add a new subparagraph (B) that\nwould establish NO emission standards for stationary diesel engines based on the size\nX\nof the stationary diesel engine and the date the engine was installed, modified,\nreconstructed, or relocated in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area. The\nproposed NO standards in new §117.205(a)(3)(B) are based on EPA’s Tier 4 emission\nX\nstandards for non-road diesel engines listed in 40 CFR §1039.101, Table 1 (effective\nJuly 29, 2021). While EPA’s Tier 4 emission standards are also based on engine size,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 18\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nthey differ from TCEQ’s standards in proposed new §117.205(a)(3)(B) in that they are\nalso based on the engine model year and the dedicated end-use for larger diesel\nengines.\nWith promulgation of the new Tier 4 diesel emission standards in 40 CFR Part 1039,\nEPA established another comprehensive, new program to phase in more stringent Tier\n4 emission standards for all diesel engine sizes, similar to its earlier rulemaking efforts\nfor the Tier 2 and Tier 3 emission standards. The Tier 4 emission standards were\nphased in beginning with model year 2008, requiring lower standards for certain\nengine sizes and model years 2011 and 2012, and being fully implemented by 2015.\nSome of the Tier 4 NO emission standards for certain engine sizes and model years\nX\noverlap with some of EPA’s prior tier emission standards.\nBecause some of EPA’s Tier 4 exhaust emission standards for diesel engines are\nexpressed in terms of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) + NO , the commission used\nX\nTable 7: Tier 2 and Tier 3 Combined and Estimated Pollutant-Specific Emissions\nStandards for Nonroad Diesel Engines from EPA’s Exhaust and Crankcase Emission\nFactors for Nonroad Engine Modeling--Compression-Ignition, Report No. NR-009C\n(EPA420-P-04-009, revised April 2004) to split the combined NMHC + NO Tier 4\nX\nstandards into single pollutant emission standards for NO , where necessary.\nX\nProposed new §117.205(a)(3)(B)(i) – (iv) would establish NO emissions performance\nX\nstandards for stationary diesel engines rated less than 25 hp and through 750 hp and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 19\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nthat are installed, modified, reconstructed, or relocated on or after March 1, 2026.\nProposed new §117.205(a)(3)(B)(v) would establish a NO emission specification for\nX\nstationary diesel engines rated greater than 750 hp that are electric generator sets and\nare installed, modified, reconstructed, or relocated on or after March 1, 2026. Proposed\nnew §117.205(a)(3)(B)(vi) would establish a NO emission specification for stationary\nX\ndiesel engines rated greater than 750 hp that exclude electric generator sets and are\ninstalled, modified, reconstructed, or relocated on or after March 1, 2026.\nProposed revisions to §117.205(a) include a new paragraph (4) to specify new NO\nX\nemission specifications for process heaters located at NO major sources in the Bexar\nX\nCounty ozone nonattainment area. Proposed new §117.205(a)(4)(A) would include a\nNO emission specification of 0.025 pounds per million British thermal units\nX\n(lb/MMBtu) for process heaters with a maximum rated capacity equal to or greater than\n40 million British thermal units per hour (MMBtu/hr). Proposed new §117.205(a)(4)(B)\nwould include a NO emission limit of 0.036 lb/MMBtu (or alternatively, 30 parts per\nX\nmillion by volume (ppmv), at 3.0% oxygen (O ), dry basis) for process heaters with a\n2\nmaximum rated capacity less than 40 MMBtu/hr. Post-combustion NO control such as\nX\nselective catalytic reduction (SCR) may be necessary for some gas-fired process heaters\nwith a maximum rated capacity equal to or greater than 40 MMBtu/hr to comply with\nthe proposed 0.025 lb/MMBtu emission specification. Given advancements in burner\ntechnology to produce the same output with fewer NO emissions, some units of this\nX\nsize category may be able to meet the proposed limit of 0.025 lb/MMBtu through\ncombustion modifications such as low-NO burners (LNB), or more specifically the next\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 20\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\ngeneration of LNB or ultra low-NO burners (ULNB). Owners or operators of gas-fired\nX\nprocess heaters with maximum rated capacities less than 40 MMBtu/hr may be\nrequired to install LNB, ULNB, or make other combustion modifications to comply with\nthe proposed 0.036 lb/MMBtu (or 30 ppmv, at 3.0% O , dry) emission specification. No\n2\nliquid-fired process heaters were identified in the 2022 point source EI in the Bexar\nCounty ozone nonattainment area; however, SCR may be necessary for a liquid-fired\nprocess heater to comply with the proposed emission specifications. The NO emission\nX\nstandards for units located in Bexar County are proposed at the same NO\nX\nperformance level for ICI process heaters located at major NO sources in the DFW\nX\neight-hour ozone nonattainment area, §117.410(a)(3), and in the HGB ozone\nnonattainment area, §117.310(a)(8)(A), respectively.\nProposed new §117.205(a)(5) would establish a 0.036 lb/MMBtu NO emission\nX\nspecification for natural gas-fired ovens used in industrial, commercial, or institutional\nprocesses. This proposed new emission specification is anticipated to be achievable\nthrough combustion modifications, such as burner modifications or installation of LNB\nor possibly ULNB. The proposed emission limit in new §117.205(a)(5) aligns with the\nNO emission specification for natural gas-fired ovens subject to §117.410(a)(12) for\nX\nthe DFW eight-hour ozone nonattainment area. The commission did not identify in the\n2022 point source EI for the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area any ovens using\nfuels other than natural gas. However, for ovens using fuels other than natural gas,\nparticularly liquid fuels, NO emissions controls in addition to or beyond burner\nX\nmodifications, LNB, or ULNB may be necessary.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 21\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nThe commission further proposes a new §117.205(a)(6) to establish a NO emission\nX\nspecification for incinerators that would not qualify for the proposed exemption under\nproposed new §117.203(9). Owners or operators of these units would be required to\ncomply with a 0.030 lb/MMBtu emission specification. While this proposed emission\nspecification for incinerators may be achievable through installation of LNB or through\nother combustion modifications, SCR may be necessary to achieve the 0.030 lb/MMBtu\nemission specification. This proposed new NO limit for incinerators in the Bexar\nX\nCounty ozone nonattainment area is set at the same NO performance level as for\nX\nincinerators subject to the provisions of Subchapter B, Divisions 3 and 4 for the HGB\nand DFW areas (§117.310(a)(16)(B) and §117.410(a)(9)(B)), respectively.\nProposed revisions to §117.205(b), concerning NO averaging times for units subject to\nX\na NO emission specification under §117.205(a), include repealing existing\nX\n§117.205(b)(1) and proposing it as new §117.205(b)(2), with amendments. Proposed\nnew §117.205(b)(2) would specify that compliance with the NO emission specifications\nX\nin §117.205(a) must be determined on a block one-hour averaging time, in the units of\nthe applicable NO emission specification, for units that do not operate with a NO\nX X\ncontinuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) or predictive emission monitoring\nsystem (PEMS) under §117.240 of Subchapter B, Division 2. Proposed new\n§117.205(b)(2) would provide for the same requirements as existing §117.205(b)(1) and\nfurther specify that the block one-hour averaging time would apply to owners or\noperators of units that do not operate with a NO CEMS or PEMS. Proposed new\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 22\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\n§117.205(b)(2) further includes a new provision for owners or operators of process\nheaters in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area by providing an alternative NO\nX\naveraging time for demonstrating compliance with the NO limits in §117.205(a). If a\nX\nprocess heater that is subject to §117.205(a) is not operated with a NO CEMS or PEMS\nX\nunder §117.240, under proposed new §117.205(b)(2) the owner or operator may\nchoose to calculate the actual NO emissions rate from the unit on a pounds per hour\nX\nbasis by multiplying the unit’s maximum rated capacity by the unit’s applicable NO\nX\nemission specification in lb/MMBtu and using this calculated result to show\ncompliance with the applicable specifications in Subchapter B, Division 2. Under this\nalternative NO averaging time, where the owner or operator shows compliance on a\nX\nblock one-hour average in pounds per hour as opposed to on a block one-hour average\nin the units of the applicable NO emission specification, the calculated value for the\nX\nprocess heater would be compared to the performance evaluation result obtained\nthrough the emissions stack testing that would be required by the initial\ndemonstration of compliance provisions under §117.235 of Subchapter B, Division 2.\nThis alternative would allow for a direct comparison between the calculated theoretical\nemissions and the measured actual emissions, providing an alternative method to\nverify compliance with the applicable NO standard.\nX\nExisting §117.205(b)(2) is proposed to be renumbered as §117.205(b)(1), and three new\nsubparagraphs would also be added. For units, except process heaters, that operate\nwith a NO CEMS or PEMS under §117.240, the owner or operator would be able to\nX\nchoose between two different NO averaging times to show compliance with the NO\nX X\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 23\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nemission specifications in §117.205(a). Proposed new §117.205(b)(1)(A) offers\nflexibility to comply with the specifications in §117.205(a) on a 30-day rolling average\nin the units of the applicable emission standard. Proposed new §117.205(b)(1)(B) offers\nflexibility to comply with the specifications in §117.205(a) on a block one-hour average\nin the units of the applicable emission standard. The owner or operator of a process\nheater in the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area would have an additional option\nin proposed new §117.205(b)(1)(C). As an alternative to the 30-day rolling average in\nthe units of the applicable emission standard in proposed new §117.205(b)(1)(A) and\nto the block one-hour average in the units of the applicable emission standard in\nproposed new §117.205(b)(1)(B), proposed new §117.205(b)(1)(C) for process heaters\nwould offer flexibility to comply with the specifications in §117.205(a) on a block one-\nhour average in pounds per hour. Like the alternative for process heaters under\nproposed new §117.205(b)(2), with amendments, the owner or operator may choose to\ncalculate the actual NO emissions rate from the unit on a pounds per hour basis by\nX\nmultiplying the unit’s maximum rated capacity by the unit’s applicable NO emission\nX\nspecification in lb/MMBtu and using this calculated result to show compliance with the\napplicable NO emission specifications in Subchapter B, Division 2. The commission\nX\nfurther proposes to rearrange the wording of the NO averaging time for 30 days from\nX\n“rolling 30-day average” to “30-day rolling average,” to keep use of this term within the\nchapter consistent with how the term is worded within its definition in §117.10.\nThe reclassification of the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area to serious resulted\nin the identification of additional major source NO emissions units, including flares\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 24\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nand incinerators. For purposes of ozone attainment, it is necessary to prevent\ncircumvention due to the transfer of NO emissions associated with chemical-bound\nX\nnitrogen from a unit under which these emissions would be controlled to a unit that is\nnot subject to the NO emission specifications in §117.205(a), and therefore\nX\nuncontrolled. Proposed changes to §117.205(d) add a new paragraph (3) that would\nprohibit changes to a unit subject to a NO emission specification in §117.205(a) that\nX\nwould result in increased NO emissions from a unit that is not subject to the NO\nX X\nemission specifications in §117.205(a). An example of this type of change that would\nbe prohibited under proposed new §117.205(d)(3) would be redirecting one or more\nfuel or waste streams containing chemical-bound nitrogen to an incinerator with a\nmaximum rated capacity less than 40 MMBtu/hr, or a flare. The redirection of the fuel\nor waste stream would result in increased NO emissions from the unit not subject to a\nX\nNO emission specification in §117.205(a). Consequently, these additional NO\nX X\nemissions would not have been accounted for in the SIP revision for the ozone\nnonattainment area and either deemed insignificant or not needing additional NO\nX\nemissions control. The proposed prohibition threshold date of December 19, 2019, was\nthe modeling base year for the attainment demonstration SIP revision required at the\ntime that the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area was classified as moderate. The\n2019 base year was also used in the concurrent proposed Bexar County 2015 ozone\nNAAQS serious attainment demonstration SIP revision, thus the December 19, 2019,\ndate remains appropriate for the prohibition threshold. Therefore, any changes after\nDecember 19, 2019, to a unit subject to §117.205(a) that would result in increased NO\nX\nemissions from another unit not subject to §117.205(a) would be prohibited, unless\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 25\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\ncertain criteria are met, as explained below.\nAn owner or operator would be allowed to make such changes that would otherwise be\nprohibited under proposed new §117.205(d)(3) only if both of the conditions under\nproposed new §117.205(d)(3)(A) and (B) were satisfied. Under proposed new\n§117.205(d)(3)(A), the increase in NO emissions from the unit not subject to the NO\nX X\nemission specifications in §117.205(a) must be determined either using a NO CEMS or\nX\nPEMS that meets the requirements in §117.240 of Subchapter B, Division 2 or through\nemissions stack testing that meets the requirements in §117.235 of Subchapter B,\nDivision 2. Under proposed new §117.205(d)(3)(B), emission credits that are equal to\nthe increase in NO emissions from the unit not subject to the NO emission\nX X\nspecifications in §117.205(a) must be obtained and used in accordance with §117.9800\nof Subchapter H, Division 2. Any change to a unit subject to §117.205(a) that resulted\nin increased NO emissions from another unit not subject to §117.205(a) after\nX\nDecember 19, 2019, and before the effective date of this proposed rulemaking, if\nadopted, would still be prohibited. Existing §117.205(d)(3) is proposed as renumbered\n§117.205(d)(4).\nProposed revisions to §117.205 further include a new subsection (e) that would\nprohibit an owner or operator of a stationary diesel engine in the Bexar County ozone\nnonattainment area from starting or operating the stationary diesel engine between the\nhours of 6:00 a.m. and noon for testing or maintenance of the engine itself, with three\nspecified exceptions to the prohibition. This proposed new requirement on starting or\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 26\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\noperating restrictions for stationary diesel engines would delay the emissions of NO , a\nX\nkey ozone precursor, until after noon (12:00 pm) to limit ozone formation. Proposed\nnew §117.205(e)(1) would allow the starting or operation of the stationary diesel\nengine between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and noon if it is for a manufacturer’s specific\nrecommended testing requiring a run of over 18 consecutive hours. Proposed new\n§117.205(e)(2) would allow the starting or operation of the stationary diesel engine\nbetween the hours of 6:00 a.m. and noon if it is to verify reliability of emergency\nequipment (e.g., emergency generators or pumps) immediately after unforeseen\nrepairs. Routine maintenance, such as an oil change, is not considered to be an\nunforeseen repair since it can be scheduled outside the 6:00 a.m. to noon time period.\nFinally, proposed new §117.205(e)(3) would allow the starting or operation of the\nstationary diesel engine between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and noon if it is for the\npurpose of using firewater pumps that are used for emergency response training\nconducted between April 1 and October 31 of a calendar year.\nSection 117.230, Operating Requirements\nThe commission proposes a new subsection (a) in existing §117.230 to require that the\nowner or operator of any unit subject to the NO emission specifications in §117.205(a)\nx\nmust operate the unit in compliance with those limitations. The existing introductory\nrule text in §117.230 is moved to new subsection (b) in §117.230. The commission\nfurther proposes in new paragraphs (1) – (2) of proposed renumbered §117.230(b)\noperational requirements for owners or operators of process heaters that use forced\ndraft flue gas recirculation (FGR) or induced draft FGR for control of NO emissions.\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 27\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nProposed new §117.230(b)(3) would specify operational requirements for owners or\noperators of units that use steam or water injection for control of NO emissions.\nX\nExisting §117.230(1) is proposed to be renumbered as §117.230(b)(4). Existing\n§117.230(2) is proposed to be renumbered as §117.230(b)(5). Similar to the existing\nprovisions under §117.230(1) and (2), before proposed changes, for operational\nrequirements for post-combustion NO control techniques and gas-fired lean-burn\nX\nstationary engines, the purpose of proposed new §117.230(b)(1) – (3) is to require that\nequipment be operated in such a manner as to reduce NO emissions over the entire\nX\noperating range. These proposed new requirements would ensure that NO reductions\nX\nare achieved, particularly for units that operate without a NO emissions monitor, i.e. a\nX\nNO CEMS or PEMS. Finally, the commission proposes in renumbered §117.230(b)(5) to\nX\nreplace the term “gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal combustion\nengine” with the new term “stationary internal combustion engine.” This proposed\nchange in existing §117.230(2), renumbered as §117.230(b)(5), would require that all\nstationary internal combustion engines covered under Subchapter B, Division 2, and\nnot only gas-fired lean-burn stationary engines, must be checked for proper engine\noperation according to §117.8140(b) of Subchapter G, Division 2. This change would be\nnecessary to be consistent with the proposed changes for new §117.205(a)(3) as part of\nthis proposed rulemaking.\nSection 117.235, Initial Demonstration of Compliance\nThe commission proposes in revised §117.235(a) that the owner or operator of any\nNO emissions unit that does not qualify for an exemption from the NO emission\nX X\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 28\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nspecifications in Subchapter B, Division 2 is required to conduct emissions\nperformance testing for each unit that is subject to a NO emission specification of the\nX\ndivision.\nThe commission proposes in revised §117.235(e) to specify that for units operating\nwithout a NO emissions monitor, the initial demonstration of compliance with the NO\nX X\nemission specifications of Subchapter B, Division 2 must be performed according to\nthe requirements in §117.8000 of Subchapter G, Division 1. The word “initially” was\npreviously not part of the rule provision language for §117.235(e). Proposed revisions\nto §117.235(e) would follow the same intent as existing requirements in §117.235(f).\nProposed revisions to §117.235(f) include minor rewording to the subsection to make\nclear that if an owner or operator of a unit subject to the emission specifications in\n§117.205(a) is required or otherwise elects to use a NO CEMS or PEMS, which must be\nX\ninstalled, calibrated, maintained, and operated in accordance with §117.240 of\nSubchapter B, Division 2, the NO monitor must undergo monitor certification testing\nX\nfirst before being used to monitor NO emissions from the unit for both the initial\nX\ncompliance demonstration required under §117.235 and ongoing compliance\ndemonstrations required under §117.240. Requirements for a NO specification on a\nX\nblock one-hour average are deleted from §117.235(f) and moved to new §117.235(f)(2),\nas described below.\nThe commission proposes a new §117.235(f)(1) to specify how an owner or operator\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 29\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\ndemonstrating compliance with proposed revised §117.235(f) must determine the NO\nX\nemissions from the unit to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission\nspecifications of §117.205(a) for an emission specification expressed in units of\nlb/MMBtu and based on a 30-day rolling average. Proposed new §117.235(f)(2) would\nspecify how an owner or operator demonstrating compliance with proposed revised\n§117.235(f) must determine the NO emissions from the unit to demonstrate initial\nX\ncompliance with the emission specifications of §117.205(a) for an emission\nspecification on a block one-hour average. These rule provisions for demonstrating\ninitial compliance with the applicable NO emission specifications for owners or\nX\noperators of units operating with a NO monitor align with other similar provisions\nX\nthat exist in other parts of Chapter 117, specifically in §117.435(e)(1) and (2) for the\nDFW eight-hour ozone nonattainment area and in §117.335(f)(1) and (2) for the HGB\nozone nonattainment area, respectively. To be consistent with the two options for the\nNO averaging time provided in proposed renumbered §117.205(b)(1), notwithstanding\nX\nthe third option specific to owners or operators of process heaters choosing\ncompliance in units of pounds per hour, proposed new subsection (f)(1) and (2) are\nnecessary for owners or operators of units operating with a NO monitor to show\nX\ncompliance depending on the averaging time chosen by the owner or operator. If a 30-\nday rolling average is chosen under proposed new §117.205(b)(1)(A), the owner or\noperator is required to comply with proposed new §117.235(f)(1). If a block one-hour\naverage is chosen under proposed new §117.205(b)(1)(B), the owner or operator is\nrequired to comply with proposed new §117.235(f)(2).\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 30\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nProposed new §117.235(f)(1) would specify that the calculated initial 30-day average\nemission rate must be used to show initial compliance with the applicable NO\nX\nemission specification in §117.205(a). The 30-day average emission rate is calculated\nas the total NO emissions from a unit, in pounds, during a 30-day test period divided\nX\nby the total heat input to the unit, in MMBtu, during the same 30-day test period. Any\n30-day test period may be chosen by the owner or operator so long as the unit\noperates for 30 successive days for the NO emissions monitoring to occur. Proposed\nX\nnew §117.235(f)(2) would specify that any one-hour period of NO emissions\nX\nmonitoring using the certified NO monitor, while the unit operates at its maximum\nX\nrated capacity, or as near thereto as practicable, must be used to show initial\ncompliance with the applicable NO emission specification in §117.205(a). Any one-\nX\nhour period may be used by the owner or operator of the unit since a NO emissions\nX\nmonitor used in compliance with Chapter 117 must be able to show compliance with\nEPA’s regulations under 40 CFR Part 60 or Part 75, EPA-compliant NO emissions\nX\nmonitors provide hourly averages of NO emissions, and the averaging time for the\nX\ninitial compliance demonstration is on an hourly basis.\nSection 117.240, Continuous Demonstration of Compliance\nExisting §117.240(a)(2) provides alternatives to the requirements of §117.240(a)(1). The\ncommission proposes to revise §117.240(a)(2)(C) by replacing the term “gas-fired lean-\nburn stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines” with the new term,\n“stationary internal combustion engines.” This change would be necessary because the\ncommission is proposing to expand the applicability of the rule provisions of\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 31\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nSubchapter B, Division 2 to additional types of stationary engines. Proposed revised\n§117.240(a)(2)(C) would therefore specify that the alternative in existing\n§117.240(a)(2)(C) to the totalizing fuel flow metering requirement in §117.240(a)(1)\nwould be available to an owner or operator of any stationary internal combustion\nengine that triggers applicability under proposed revised §117.200.\nExisting §117.240(b)(2) specifies that units subject to the NO CEMS requirements of 40\nX\nCFR Part 75 are not required to install a NO CEMS or PEMS under §117.240(b). The\nX\ncommission proposes to expand §117.240(b)(2) to incorporate new provisions for\nstationary diesel engines. The commission proposes to move the existing exception\nprovided to units subject to 40 CFR Part 75 to a proposed new §117.240(b)(2)(A).\nProposed new §117.240(b)(2)(B) would provide an exception for owners or operators of\nstationary diesel engines with SCR systems from the requirement to install a NO CEMS\nX\nor PEMS. To qualify for the exception, the stationary diesel engine must operate with\nan SCR emissions control system for NO and meet all the criteria in proposed new\nX\n§117.240(b)(2)(B)(i) - (vi). Stationary diesel engines operated in this manner are\nexpected to be newer diesel engines that would already be certified to EPA’s Tier 4\nemission standards in 40 CFR §1039.101, Table 1 (effective July 29, 2021). Currently,\nmost diesel engine manufacturers incorporate SCR emissions control systems to\nproduce engines that can be certified to EPA’s Tier 4 emission standards for NO . The\nX\nSCR emissions control system built into the operational design of the diesel engine\nmakes the operation of the diesel engine without the SCR practically impossible. The\ncriteria specified in proposed new §117.240(b)(2)(B)(i) - (iv) are from 40 CFR Part 1039,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 32\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nSubpart B for monitoring reductant use and unit and control system diagnostic\nfunctions. Consequently, an owner or operator of a stationary diesel engine operating\nwith an SCR system and according to the conditions in proposed new §117.240(b)(2)(B)\nwould not need to monitor exhaust NO with a NO CEMS or PEMS under §117.240(b).\nX X\nThe proposed rule provisions for stationary diesel engines under §117.240(b)(2)(B) do\nnot waive the requirement for an owner or operator to demonstrate initial compliance\nwith the NO emission specifications of Subchapter B, Division 2 according to\nX\n§117.235, ongoing compliance with the engine monitoring requirements in\n§117.240(e), or ongoing compliance with the retesting provisions in §117.240(h)(2), if\nretesting is triggered.\nSimilar to the proposed revision to §117.240(a)(2)(C), proposed revisions to\n§117.240(e) include replacing the term, gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating\ninternal combustion engine, with the new term, stationary internal combustion engine.\nLike other changes proposed in this rulemaking for stationary engines, this change\nwould be necessary to extend existing engine monitoring requirements to all stationary\nengines that would trigger applicability to the rule provisions of Subchapter B, Division\n2 through proposed revised §117.200. The commission also proposes to add language\nto §117.240(e) to make clear that the requirement to stack test is for engines that are\nnot equipped with a NO CEMS or PEMS. For stationary engines not required to operate\nX\nwith a NO monitor, or for those units for which the owner or operator elects not to\nX\nuse a NO monitor, owners or operators of stationary engines that trigger the engine\nX\nemissions monitoring requirement under §117.240(e) would be required to conduct\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 33\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nperiodic emissions testing in accordance with the provisions in §117.8140(a). This\nrequirement to conduct periodic emissions testing for stationary engines exists in\n§117.440(h) for stationary gas engines in the DFW eight-hour ozone nonattainment\narea and in §117.340(h) for all stationary engines in the HGB ozone nonattainment\narea.\nSection §117.240(f) requires owners or operators of stationary gas turbines or gas-\nfired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines to record the\nunit’s operating time with a non-resettable elapsed run time meter if the unit is\nclaimed exempt using the exemption in §117.203(1)(D). Proposed revised §117.240(f)\nwould extend the existing run time meter and operating time recording requirement to\nowners or operators of units claimed exempt using the exemptions in proposed new\n§117.203(2) or in proposed new §117.203(3). Like other proposed changes for\nstationary engines in this proposed rulemaking, the commission proposes to also\nreplace the term gas-fired lean-burn stationary reciprocating internal combustion\nengine with the new term stationary internal combustion engine in proposed revised\n§117.240(f). These proposed new inclusions for §117.240(f) would mirror, as\nnecessary, existing rule provision requirements for stationary gas turbines and\nstationary internal combustion engines for units claimed exempt in the DFW eight-\nhour ozone nonattainment area, in §117.440(i), and in the HGB ozone nonattainment\narea, in §117.340(j).\nTo be consistent with the proposed clarification in §117.240(e) concerning stationary\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 34\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nengines that do not operate with a NO emissions monitor, either a CEMS or PEMS, the\nX\ncommission proposes to clarify in §117.240(h)(2) that for units not operating with a\nNO monitor, owners or operators of such units must retest their units, as specified in\nX\n§117.235, within 60 days after any modification to a unit that could reasonably be\nexpected to increase the NO emissions rate from the modified unit. The NO emissions\nX X\nretesting would be conducted according to §117.235(a), (e), and (g) of Subchapter B,\nDivision 2. The emissions retesting provision in §117.240(h)(2) applies to any unit\nsubject to a NO emission specification in §117.205(a) that does not use a NO monitor\nX X\nand for which a modification occurs that could reasonably be expected to increase the\nNO emissions rate from the unit.\nX\nSection 117.245, Notification, Recordkeeping, and Reporting Requirements\nThe commission proposes to move the existing notification requirements for owners\nor operators of units subject to the NO emission specifications in §117.205(a) from\nX\n§117.245(b) to new paragraphs (1) and (2) within the subsection. The purpose is to\nmake clearer, by separating into two new paragraphs, the existing notification\nrequirements for emissions testing conducted under §117.235, in proposed new\n§117.245(b)(1), and the existing notification requirements for NO monitor\nX\nperformance evaluations conducted under §117.240, in proposed new §117.245(b)(2).\nProposed revisions to §117.245(e) include replacing the existing term, “gas-fired\nengine,” with the new term, “stationary internal combustion engine.” This change\nwould be necessary to be consistent with the other changes proposed in this\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 35\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nrulemaking to extend the applicability of the rule provisions of Subchapter B, Division\n2 to additional stationary engine types. Therefore, owners or operators of stationary\ngas-fired lean-burn engines not fired on landfill gas, stationary gas-fired engines fired\non landfill gas, and stationary diesel engines, subject to the NO emission\nX\nspecifications of §117.205(a), would be required to report in writing to the commission\non a semiannual basis any excess emissions and air-fuel ratio monitoring system\nperformance, as applicable.\nThe current rule provision reference to §117.230(a)(2) in §117.245(e)(1) is proposed to\nbe revised to new §117.230(b)(5) to be consistent with the proposed changes to\n§117.230. The commission further notes that the current rule provision reference to\n§117.230(a)(2) is incorrect; the correct current rule provision reference is §117.230(2).\nThe commission proposes to remove the word “daily” from existing §117.245(f)(2)(B)\nbecause current rule provisions under Subchapter B, Division 2 do not specify any NO\nX\nemission specifications on a daily basis. Current rule provisions under §117.205 and\n§117.235 specify compliance only on either a one-hour or a 30-day basis for units that\noperate with a NO CEMS or PEMS. Proposed changes to §117.245(f)(3)(A)(i) would\nX\ninclude revising the current rule provision reference from §117.230(2) to new\n§117.230(b)(5). This change would be necessary pursuant to the changes proposed to\n§117.230 of Subchapter B, Division 2. Section §117.245(f)(3)(A) specifies requirements\nfor owners or operators of stationary internal combustion engines, subject to the NO\nX\nemission specifications of Subchapter B, Division 2, to maintain records of emissions\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 36\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nmeasurements required by new §117.230(b)(5) and §117.240(e) of the division.\nProposed changes to §117.245(f)(4) would include adding rule provision references to\nnew §117.203(2) and (3) to include the proposed new exemptions for stationary diesel\nengines that operate less than 100 hours per year based on a rolling 12-month basis.\nSection §117.245(f)(4) specifies requirements for owners or operators of units claimed\nexempt from the emission specifications of Subchapter B, Division 2. For exemptions\nbased on hours per year of operation, maintaining records of monthly hours of\noperation is required. For exemptions based on dedicated use, keeping records of the\nunit’s purpose of use is required. Furthermore, the commission proposes to add to\n§117.245(f)(4) a rule provision reference to the definition of emergency situation in\n§117.10(15). The term itself already exists within the rule provision text of\n§117.245(f)(4). The purpose is to remind owners or operators of potentially affected\nunits that the term is defined for purposes of Chapter 117, and not all situations that\nmay occur may qualify as an emergency situation for purposes of Chapter 117.\nProposed revisions to §117.245(f) concerning recordkeeping requirements include a\nnew paragraph (7) for owners or operators of stationary diesel engines subject to the\noperating restrictions in proposed new §117.205(e). Similar to existing provisions for\nowners or operators of stationary diesel engine in the DFW eight-hour ozone\nnonattainment area, in §117.445(f)(9), and in the HGB ozone nonattainment area, in\n§117.345(f)(10), proposed new §117.245(f)(7) would require owners or operators to\nmaintain records of each time a stationary diesel engine is operated for testing and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 37\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nmaintenance of the engine itself, including the date(s) of engine operation; the start\nand end times of engine operation; the identification of the engine; and the total hours\nof engine operation for each month and for the most recent 12 consecutive months.\nThis proposed new recordkeeping requirement would apply for each stationary diesel\nengine that is subject to the operating restrictions of §117.240(e) to ensure compliance\nwith the proposed restriction on operating hours for testing and maintenance of a\nstationary diesel engine.\nSubchapter H, Administrative Provisions\nDivision 1, Compliance Schedules\nSection 117.9010, Compliance Schedule for Bexar County Ozone Nonattainment\nMajor Sources\nProposed revisions to §117.9010(a) include new paragraphs (1) and (2) to specify when\nowners or operators of units subject to the requirements of Subchapter B, Division 2\nare required to demonstrate compliance with those requirements. Proposed new\n§117.9010(a)(1) would preserve prior compliance deadlines for submittal of the control\nplan and all other requirements of Chapter 117, Subchapter B, Division 2 for units\nsubject to the NO emission specifications in §117.205(a) that were subject to the prior\nX\ndefinition of \"Major source\" for the Bexar County ozone nonattainment in\n§117.10(29)(B) before the effective date of this current rulemaking – those that emit or\nhave the potential to emit equal to or greater than 100 tpy of NO . The prior\nX\ncompliance deadline of January 1, 2025, for control plans is proposed in new\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 38\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\n§117.9010(a)(1)(A). The prior compliance deadline of January 1, 2025, for all other\nrequirements of Subchapter B, Division 2, when the area was classified as moderate\nozone nonattainment, is proposed in new §117.9010(a)(1)(B). Proposed new\n§117.9010(a)(1)(B) further specifies that units that were required to demonstrate\ncompliance by January 1, 2025, must continue to demonstrate compliance with the\nrequirements of Subchapter B Division 2. Finally, the commission proposes in new\n§117.9010(a)(1)(C) that for units that became subject to the NO emission\nX\nspecifications in §117.205(a) after January 1, 2025, compliance with the requirements\nof Subchapter B, Division 2 is required as soon as practicable but no later than 60 days\nafter becoming subject. These changes are intended to provide clarity and distinguish\nbetween the prior compliance deadline of January 1, 2025, in proposed new\n§117.9010(a)(1)(A) - (C) relating to the compliance date for the Bexar County ozone\nnonattainment area under a moderate classification and the proposed new deadlines in\nnew §117.9010(a)(2). These proposed changes in §117.9010(a) are not intended to\nchange the existing requirements for those units that had a rule provision compliance\ndeadline of January 1, 2025.\nProposed new §117.9010(a)(2)(A) - (B) would specify the compliance deadlines for units\nsubject to the NO emission specifications of §117.205(a) that become subject to the\nX\nproposed revised definition of “Major Source” for the Bexar County ozone\nnonattainment area in proposed revised §117.10(29)(B). The commission proposes a\ncompliance deadline of February 1, 2026, in proposed new §117.9010(a)(2)(A) for\nsubmission of the control plan required by §117.252 and March 1, 2026, in proposed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 39\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nnew §117.9010(a)(2)(B) for demonstrating compliance with all other applicable\nrequirements of Chapter 117, Subchapter B, Division 2. The compliance date assures\nthat NO reductions would occur by the start of ozone season in Bexar County in 2026,\nX\nthe year used to determine attainment with the 2015 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.\nThe commission does not propose any changes to existing §117.9010(b), which\nspecifies that the owner or operator of any stationary source of NO that becomes\nX\nsubject to the requirements of Chapter 117, Subchapter B, Division 2 on or after the\napplicable compliance date specified in subsection (a) of the section must comply with\nthe requirements of the division as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after\nbecoming subject to the requirements of the division. Considering the reclassification\nof the Bexar County ozone nonattainment area and the new NO major source\nX\nthreshold, an owner or operator of any stationary source of NO that becomes subject\nX\nto the requirements of proposed revised Subchapter B, Division 2 on or after March 1,\n2026, must comply with the requirements of Chapter 117, Subchapter B, Division 2 as\nsoon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after becoming subject. For example,\nowners or operators of new units placed into service on or after March 1, 2026, would\nbe required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the division within 60\ndays after startup of the unit. Owners or operators of existing units previously claimed\nexempt from the rule provisions but no longer qualifying for exemption after March 1,\n2026, would be required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the\ndivision by no later than 60 days after the unit no longer qualifies for the previously\nclaimed exemption.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 40\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nFiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government\nKyle Girten, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the\nfirst five-year period the proposed rules are in effect, no significant fiscal implications\nare anticipated for TCEQ during implementation of the proposed rule. No fiscal\nimplications are anticipated for other state or local government entities.\nPublic Benefits and Costs\nMr. Girten determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are\nin effect, the public benefit anticipated will be compliance with federal law and\ncontinued protection of the environment and public health and safety combined with\nefficient and fair administration of NO emission standards for Bexar County.\nX\nCorrections of errors and other non-substantive changes within the rule would also\nbenefit the public.\nCosts would be incurred for affected businesses operating in Bexar County for\nimplementation of requirements appliable to RACT. Revisions to §117.10 would lower\nthe threshold for major sources from 100 tpy to 50 tpy NO in Bexar County, so any\nX\nsources emitting or with the potential to emit 50-100 tpy NO in Bexar County would\nX\nbe impacted by this rulemaking. Additionally, revisions to Subchapter B, Division 2\nwould expand the applicability of RACT requirements as applicable to NO to include\nX\ngas engines fired on landfill gas, diesel engines, boilers, process heaters, ovens, and\nincinerators, so any applicable requirements in Chapter 117 would apply to all major\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 41\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nsources with these technologies.\nIt is estimated that four businesses would be affected by this rulemaking. This\nincludes one landfill/waste-to-gas management plant with five stationary diesel\nengines and four flares (subject to federal new source review requirements); one waste-\nto-gas energy production plant with six stationary gas-fired, lean-burn engines; one\npetroleum refinery with nine process heaters, four stationary diesel engines, two\nincinerators, and two flares (subject to federal new source review requirements); and\none vehicle automative manufacturer plant with two incinerators and seven ovens.\nFor the landfill/waste-to-gas management plant, total costs are estimated at $24,000-\n$39,000 for the first, third, and fifth year after the rulemaking is in effect, and $9,400-\n$18,400 in years two and four. Capital purchases were assumed to be annualized over\n15 years with an 8.25% rate on the loan. Costs include purchase of new Tier 2, Tier 3,\nand Tier 4 diesel engines and other equipment, operating and maintenance costs, the\npurchase and operation of flow meters, and costs associated with stack testing.\nFor the waste-to-gas energy production plant, total costs are estimated at $35,000 in\nyears one, three, and five and $5,800 in years two and four. Capital purchases were\nassumed to be annualized over 15 years with an 8.25% rate on the loan. Costs include\nthe purchase of flow meters, annual operating and maintenance costs, stack testing\ncosts, and costs associated with recordkeeping and reporting. None of the six engines\nat this site are anticipated to need to implement additional controls to meet proposed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 42\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nemissions specifications for stationary gas-fired, lean burn engines fired on landfill\ngas.\nFor the petroleum refinery, total costs are estimated at $199,000 in year one and\n$154,600 in years two through five. Capital purchases were assumed to be annualized\nover 15 years with an 8.25% rate on the loan. Costs include the purchase of ultra-low-\nNO burners for six process heaters, tests of the burners, the purchase of flow meters,\nX\nthe purchase of non-resettable run time meters for four stationary diesel engines,\nstack testing costs, and costs associated with recordkeeping and reporting. It is\nassumed that four stationary diesel engines would qualify for an exemption, either\nbased on dedicated use or low operational use; and two incinerators would qualify for\nan exemption based on unit size.\nFor the vehicle automotive manufacturer, total costs are estimated at $22,000 in year\none and $2,200 in years two through five. Capital purchases were assumed to be\nannualized over 15 years with an 8.25% rate on the loan. Costs include the purchase of\nflow meters, operating and maintenance costs, stack testing costs, and costs\nassociated with recordkeeping and reporting. It is assumed that two incinerators and\nthree of the gas-fired ovens would qualify for an exemption from requirements based\non unit size. The remaining four ovens are not anticipated to require additional control\nmeasures.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 43\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nLocal Employment Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Local\nEmployment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking is not\nanticipated to adversely affect a local economy in a significant way for the first five\nyears that the proposed rule is in effect.\nRural Communities Impact Assessment\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first\nfive years that the proposed rules are in effect. This rulemaking applies to Bexar\nCounty, which has a large population; therefore, rural communities are not\nsignificantly impacted.\nSmall Business and Micro-Business Assessment\nNo adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro-businesses due to the\nimplementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period\nthe proposed rules are in effect. No small businesses have been identified that would\nbe affected by this rulemaking.\nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Small\nBusiness Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does\nnot adversely affect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 44\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nGovernment Growth Impact Statement\nThe commission prepared a Government Growth Impact Statement assessment for this\nproposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a\ngovernment program and will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative\nappropriations to the agency. The proposed rulemaking does not require the creation\nof new employee positions, eliminate current employee positions, nor require an\nincrease or decrease in fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking amends an\nexisting regulation, and it does not increase or decrease the number of individuals\nsubject to its applicability. During the first five years, the proposed rule should not\nimpact positively or negatively the state’s economy.\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking in light of the regulatory impact\nanalysis requirements of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225 and determined that\nthe proposed rulemaking does not meet the definition of a major environmental rule\nas defined in that statute, and in addition, if it did meet the definition, would not be\nsubject to the requirement to prepare a regulatory impact analysis. A major\nenvironmental rule means a rule, the specific intent of which is to protect the\nenvironment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure, and that\nmay adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy,\nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 45\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nstate or a sector of the state. Additionally, the proposed rulemaking does not meet any\nof the four applicability criteria for requiring a regulatory impact analysis for a major\nenvironmental rule, which are listed in Tex. Gov’t Code Ann., §2001.0225(a). Section\n2001.0225 of the Texas Government Code applies only to a major environmental rule,\nthe result of which is to: 1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is\nspecifically required by state law; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless\nthe rule is specifically required by federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a delegation\nagreement or contract between the state and an agency or representative of the federal\ngovernment to implement a state and federal program; or 4) adopt a rule solely under\nthe general powers of the agency instead of under a specific state law.\nThe specific intent of these proposed rules is to comply with federal requirements for\nthe implementation of control strategies necessary to attain and maintain the NAAQS\nfor ozone mandated by 42 United States Code (USC), 7410, FCAA, §110 and required to\nbe included in operating permits by 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA, §502, as specified\nelsewhere in this preamble. The proposed rulemaking addresses RACT requirements\nfor the Bexar County 2015 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area as discussed\nelsewhere in this preamble. States are required to adopt SIPs with enforceable emission\nlimitations and other control measures, means, or techniques, as well as schedules and\ntimetables for compliance, as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable\nrequirements of the FCAA. As discussed in the FISCAL NOTE portion of this preamble,\nthe proposed rules are not anticipated to add any significant additional costs to\naffected individuals or businesses beyond what is necessary to attain the ozone\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 46\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nNAAQS on the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the\nenvironment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.\nIf a state does not comply with its obligations under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110 to\nsubmit SIPs, states are subject to discretionary sanctions under 42 USC, §7410(m) or\nmandatory sanctions under 42 USC, §7509, FCAA, §179; as well as the imposition of a\nfederal implementation plan (FIP) under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110(c). Under 42 USC,\n§7661a, FCAA, §502, states are required to have federal operating permit programs\nthat provide authority to issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable\nstandard, regulation, or requirement under the FCAA, including enforceable emission\nlimitations and other control measures, means, or techniques, which are required\nunder 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110. Similar to requirements in 42 USC, §7410, FCAA,\n§110, states are not free to ignore requirements in 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA, §502 and\nmust develop and submit programs to provide for operating permits for major sources\nthat include all applicable requirements of the FCAA. Lastly, states are also subject to\nthe imposition of sanctions under 42 USC, §7661a(d) and (i), FCAA, §502(d) and (i) for\nfailure to submit an operating permits program, the disapproval of any operating\npermits program, or failure to adequately administer and enforce the approved\noperating permits program.\nThe requirement to provide a fiscal analysis of regulations in the Texas Government\nCode was amended by Senate Bill (SB) 633 during the 75th legislative session in 1997.\nThe intent of SB 633 was to require agencies to conduct a regulatory impact analysis of\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 47\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nextraordinary rules. These are identified in the statutory language as major\nenvironmental rules that will have a material adverse impact and will exceed a\nrequirement of state law, federal law, or a delegated federal program, or are adopted\nsolely under the general powers of the agency. With the understanding that this\nrequirement would seldom apply, the commission provided a cost estimate for SB 633\nthat concluded “based on an assessment of rules adopted by the agency in the past, it\nis not anticipated that the bill will have significant fiscal implications for the agency\ndue to its limited application.” The commission also noted that the number of rules\nthat would require assessment under the provisions of the bill was not large. This\nconclusion was based, in part, on the criteria set forth in the bill that exempted rules\nfrom the full analysis unless the rule was a major environmental rule that exceeds a\nfederal law. Because of the ongoing need to meet federal requirements, the\ncommission routinely proposes and adopts rules incorporating or designed to satisfy\nspecific federal requirements. The legislature is presumed to understand this federal\nscheme. If each rule proposed by the commission to meet a federal requirement was\nconsidered to be a major environmental rule that exceeds federal law, then each of\nthose rules would require the full regulatory impact analysis (RIA) contemplated by SB\n633. Requiring a full RIA for all federally required rules is inconsistent with the\nconclusions reached by the commission in its cost estimate and by the Legislative\nBudget Board (LBB) in its fiscal notes. Since the legislature is presumed to understand\nthe fiscal impacts of the bills it passes, and that presumption is based on information\nprovided by state agencies and the LBB, the that the intent of SB 633 was only to\nrequire the full RIA for rules that are extraordinary in nature. While the proposed rules\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 48\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nmay have a broad impact, that impact is no greater than is necessary or appropriate to\nmeet the requirements of the FCAA, and in fact creates no additional impacts since the\nproposed rules do not impose burdens greater than required to demonstrate\nattainment of the ozone NAAQS as discussed elsewhere in this preamble. For these\nreasons, the proposed rules fall under the exception in Texas Government Code,\n§2001.0225(a), because they are required by, and do not exceed, federal law.\nThe commission has consistently applied this construction to its rules since this\nstatute was enacted in 1997. Since that time, the legislature has revised the Texas\nGovernment Code, but left this provision substantially unamended. It is presumed that\n“when an agency interpretation is in effect at the time the legislature amends the laws\nwithout making substantial change in the statute, the legislature is deemed to have\naccepted the agency’s interpretation.” (Central Power & Light Co. v. Sharp, 919 S.W.2d\n485, 489 (Tex. App. Austin 1995), writ denied with per curiam opinion respecting\nanother issue, 960 S.W.2d 617 (Tex. 1997); Bullock v. Marathon Oil Co., 798 S.W.2d 353,\n357 (Tex. App. Austin 1990, no writ). Cf. Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Calvert, 414\nS.W.2d 172 (Tex. 1967); Dudney v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 9 S.W.3d 884, 893\n(Tex. App. Austin 2000); Southwestern Life Ins. Co. v. Montemayor, 24 S.W.3d 581 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 2000, pet. denied); and Coastal Indust. Water Auth. v. Trinity Portland\nCement Div., 563 S.W.2d 916 (Tex. 1978).) The commission’s interpretation of the RIA\nrequirements is also supported by a change made to the Texas Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA) by the legislature in 1999. In an attempt to limit the number of\nrule challenges based upon APA requirements, the legislature clarified that state\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 49\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nagencies are required to meet these sections of the APA against the standard of\n“substantial compliance” (Texas Government Code, §2001.035). The legislature\nspecifically identified Texas Government Code, §2001.0225 as falling under this\nstandard.\nAs discussed in this analysis and elsewhere in this preamble, the commission has\nsubstantially complied with the requirements of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225.\nThe proposed rulemaking implements the requirements of the FCAA as discussed in\nthis analysis and elsewhere in this preamble. The proposed rules were determined to\nbe necessary to attain the ozone NAAQS and are required to be included in permits\nunder 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA, §502 and will not exceed any standard set by state or\nfederal law. These proposed rules are not an express requirement of state law. The\nproposed rules do not exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or a contract\nbetween state and federal government, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the\ncommission and approved by EPA, will become federal law as part of the approved SIP\nrequired by 42 U.S.C. §7410, FCAA, §110. The proposed rules were not developed\nsolely under the general powers of the agency but are authorized by specific sections\nof Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 382 (also known as the Texas Clean Air Act),\nand the Texas Water Code, which are cited in the Statutory Authority section of this\npreamble, including Texas Health and Safety Code, §§382.011, 382.012, and 382.017.\nTherefore, this proposed rulemaking action is not subject to the regulatory analysis\nprovisions of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225(b).\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 50\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nThe commission invites public comment regarding the Draft Regulatory Impact\nAnalysis Determination during the public comment period. Written comments on the\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination may be submitted to the contact\nperson at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nTakings Impact Assessment\nUnder Texas Government Code, §2007.002(5), taking means a governmental action that\naffects private real property, in whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a\nmanner that requires the governmental entity to compensate the private real property\nowner as provided by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution or §17 or §19, Article I, Texas Constitution; or a governmental action that\naffects an owner’s private real property that is the subject of the governmental action,\nin whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a manner that restricts or limits\nthe owner’s right to the property that would otherwise exist in the absence of the\ngovernmental action; and is the producing cause of a reduction of at least 25% in the\nmarket value of the affected private real property, determined by comparing the\nmarket value of the property as if the governmental action is not in effect and the\nmarket value of the property determined as if the governmental action is in effect. The\ncommission completed a takings impact analysis for the proposed rulemaking action\nunder the Texas Government Code, §2007.043.\nThe primary purpose of this proposed rulemaking action, as discussed elsewhere in\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 51\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nthis preamble, is to meet federal requirements for the implementation of control\nstrategies necessary to attain and maintain the NAAQS for ozone mandated by 42\nUnited States Code (USC), 7410, FCAA, §110 and required to be included in operating\npermits by 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA, §502. The proposed rulemaking addresses RACT\nrequirements for the Bexar County 2015 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area as\ndiscussed elsewhere in this preamble.\nStates are required to adopt SIPs with enforceable emission limitations and other\ncontrol measures, means, or techniques, as well as schedules and timetables for\ncompliance, as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements\nof the FCAA. If a state does not comply with its obligations under 42 USC, §7410,\nFCAA, §110 to submit SIPs, states are subject to discretionary sanctions under 42 USC,\n§7410(m) or mandatory sanctions under 42 USC, §7509, FCAA, §179; as well as the\nimposition of a FIP under 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110(c). Under 42 USC, §7661a, FCAA,\n§502, states are required to have federal operating permit programs that provide\nauthority to issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable standard,\nregulation, or requirement under the FCAA, including enforceable emission limitations\nand other control measures, means, or techniques, which are required under 42 USC,\n§7410, FCAA, §110. Similar to requirements in 42 USC, §7410, FCAA, §110, regarding\nthe requirement to adopt and implement plans to attain and maintain the national\nambient air quality standards, states are not free to ignore requirements in 42 USC,\n§7661a, FCAA, §502 and must develop and submit programs to provide for operating\npermits for major sources that include all applicable requirements of the FCAA. Lastly,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 52\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nstates are also subject to the imposition of sanctions under 42 USC, §7661a(d) and (i),\nFCAA, §502(d) and (i) for failure to submit an operating permits program, the\ndisapproval of any operating permits program, or failure to adequately administer and\nenforce the approved operating permits program.\nThe proposed rules will not create any additional burden on private real property\nbeyond what is required under federal law, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the\ncommission and approved by EPA, will become federal law as part of the approved SIP\nrequired by 42 U.S.C. §7410, FCAA, §110. The proposed rules will not affect private\nreal property in a manner that would require compensation to private real property\nowners under the United States Constitution or the Texas Constitution. The proposal\nalso will not affect private real property in a manner that restricts or limits an owner’s\nright to the property that would otherwise exist in the absence of the governmental\naction. Therefore, the proposed rulemaking will not cause a taking under Texas\nGovernment Code, Chapter 2007.\nConsistency with the Coastal Management Program\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking and found the proposal is a\nrulemaking identified in the Coastal Coordination Act Implementation Rules, 31 TAC\n§29.11(b)(2) (or §29.11(b)(4), whichever is applicable) relating to rules subject to the\nCoastal Management Program, and will, therefore, require that goals and policies of the\nTexas Coastal Management Program (CMP) be considered during the rulemaking\nprocess. Note: §29.11(b)(2) applies only to air pollutant emissions, on-site sewage\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 53\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\ndisposal systems, and underground storage tanks. §29.11(b)(4) applies to all other\nactions.\nThe commission reviewed this rulemaking for consistency with the CMP goals and\npolicies in accordance with the regulations of the Coastal Coordination Advisory\nCommittee and determined that the rulemaking will not affect any coastal natural\nresource areas because the rules only affect counties outside the CMP area and is,\ntherefore, consistent with CMP goals and policies.\nWritten comments on the consistency of this rulemaking may be submitted to the\ncontact person at the address listed under the SUBMITTAL OF COMMENTS section of\nthis preamble.\nEffect on Sites Subject to the Federal Operating Permits Program\nChapter 117 is an applicable requirement under 30 TAC Chapter 122, Federal\nOperating Permits Program. Once adopted, owners or operators of affected sites\nsubject to the federal operating permit program must, consistent with the revision\nprocess in Chapter 122, upon the effective date of the rulemaking, revise their\noperating permit to include the new Chapter 117 requirements.\nAnnouncement of Hearing\nThe commission will offer a public hearing on this proposal in San Antonio on August\n19, 2025, at 7:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time at the Alamo Area Council of\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 54\nChapter 117 – Control of Air Pollution from Nitrogen Compounds\nRule Project No. 2025-007-117-AI\nGovernments at 2700 NE Loop 410, Suite 101. The hearing is structured for the receipt\nof oral or written comments by interested persons. Individuals may present oral\nstatements when called upon in order of registration. Open discussion will not be\npermitted during the hearing; however, commission staff members will be available to\ndiscuss the proposal 30 minutes prior to the hearing.

    "full_text": "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 1\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (commission or TCEQ) proposes\namendments to 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) §60.1 and §60.2.\nBackground and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules\nThe commission proposes revisions to Chapter 60 to implement certain requirements\nof Senate Bill (SB) 1397, regarding compliance history. SB 1397, 88th Legislature, 2023,\nSection 13, amended Texas Water Code (TWC) §5.754 requiring the commission to\nconsider major, moderate, and minor violations when determining repeat violators.\nThis proposed rulemaking also addresses management recommendations adopted by\nthe Sunset Advisory Commission that were not included in SB 1397 for the\ncommission to review and update the agency’s compliance history rating formula to\nensure it accurately reflects a regulated entity’s record of violations, including\nconsiderations of site complexity and cumulative violations or repeating violations;\nand to regularly update compliance history ratings.\nSection by Section Discussion\n§60.1, Compliance History\nThe commission proposes revisions to §60.1(a)(6) and (7) to establish the effective date\nof the proposed rule. The commission will continue to use the version of the rule in\neffect at the time the compliance history classification was calculated in accordance\nwith §60.1(b). For example, when an application for a permit is received by the\nexecutive director, the version of Chapter 60 in effect at the time the application is\nreceived will be the version used for compliance history purposes. The commission\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nmay consider new compliance history information as it deems necessary.\nThe proposal amends §60.1(b) to change the compliance period for enforcement\nactions to be calculated from the initial enforcement screening date. The compliance\nhistory period for an enforcement action is currently based on the date of the initial\nmailing of the enforcement settlement offer or petition, whichever occurs first. Since\ncomplicated cases may take substantial time to develop, the compliance history period\ncould change while the settlement offer or petition is being drafted. Changing the start\nof the compliance period to the initial screening of an enforcement action means the\ncompliance history will more closely reflect the performance of the site at the time the\nviolations were documented as opposed to several months later. This provides greater\ncertainty to the regulated community as to how an entity is performing at the time an\nenforcement action begins. This also means a site’s compliance history will remain the\nsame throughout the drafting and review process of the initial proposed agreed order\nor the petition instead of requiring additional reviews to verify whether the compliance\nhistory has changed during the process. In addition, clarification is made on how\nNotices of Violation are considered consistent with changes to §60.2(f).\nProposed §60.1(c)(8) changes the language referencing the Texas Environmental,\nHealth, and Safety Audit Privilege Act. The Act was amended by the 85th Legislature in\n2017 and the proposed language recognizes this change.\n§60.2, Classification\nThe proposal amends §60.2(a) to change the frequency that the executive director shall\nevaluate the compliance history of each site from annually to bi-annually. This\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 3\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nimplements a management recommendation adopted by the Sunset Advisory\nCommission to regularly update an entity’s compliance history rating. The commission\nproposes that compliance histories be evaluated on March 1st and September 1st each\nyear. Since 2002, when the rule originally established an annual review, technological\nadvances have made it possible for the agency to increase the number of reviews per\nyear without overburdening agency resources. Bi-annual reviews will allow for\nappropriate planning for announced and unannounced investigations, as well as\nincreased oversight of unsatisfactory performers. More frequent evaluations better\nallow the commission to consider whether proceedings should be initiated to revoke a\npermit, or to amend a permit where statutes allow, of an unsatisfactory performer. The\ncommission considered other evaluation periods and determined that evaluations\nmore frequent than bi-annually may require shortening the appeal window to ensure\nappeal reviews could be completed before the next evaluation period begins.\nThe proposal amends §60.2(c) to change the methodology of grouping regulated\nentities from reliance on the North American Industry Classifications System (NAICS)\nto use of complexity points described in §60.2(e) as the commission has determined\ncomplexity to be a more accurate measurement criterion. In 2002, the commission\ndetermined Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes did not adequately capture\nthe environmental complexity of the regulated community. In 2012, the commission\nlisted NAICS codes as an option for grouping. However, over time, the commission\nfound that the self-reported NAICS codes were frequently incorrect, inaccurate, or\nfailed to fully describe the operations of the regulated site from an environmental\nimpact standpoint. Therefore, the commission has not been able to effectively use\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 4\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nNAICS codes for complexity determinations. The commission proposes to use the\ncomplexity formula to establish groupings to improve accuracy and provide certainty\nto the regulated public as they are already familiar with the formula and its impact on\na site.\nThe proposal amends §60.2(f) to reflect changes to the way in which the commission\nevaluates repeat violators as required by SB 1397. Previously, in determining whether\nan entity was a repeat violator, the commission evaluated only major violations of the\nsame nature and the same environmental media that occurred during the five-year\ncompliance period. Under the proposed rule, in accordance with SB 1397, the\ncommission will evaluate major, moderate, and minor violations of the same nature\nand environmental media that occurred during the five-year compliance period.\nThe new formula considers “repeat violation points” for each violation of the same\nnature and the same environmental media documented in any final enforcement\norders, court judgments, and criminal convictions that occurred at least three times\nduring the five-year compliance period. The number of “repeat violation points” varies\nby classification of the violation with each minor violation receiving 2 repeat violation\npoints, each moderate violation receiving 10 points, and each major violation receiving\n50 points. The total of all repeat violation points assessed to a regulated entity is used\nto determine whether the regulated entity has exceeded the repeat violation point\nthresholds to be classified as a repeat violator. The commission has established repeat\nviolation point thresholds based on complexity points. Regulated entities with 15 or\nmore complexity points and 150 or more “repeat violation points” will be classified as\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 5\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\na repeat violator, while regulated entities with less than 15 complexity points and 100\nor more “repeat violation points” will also be classified as a repeat violator.\nThe commission proposes changing §60.2(f)(1) and (2) and adding §60.2(f)(3).\nProposed §60.2(f)(1) adds moderate and minor violations to repeat violator\nconsideration and removes the requirement that violations be documented on separate\noccasions. Currently, multiple violations of the same type may be consolidated into a\nsingle enforcement action. Historically, the commission has considered “separate\noccasion” to mean individual orders or enforcement actions. For example, if a\nregulated entity had two unauthorized discharges within one compliance year and the\nentity signed a single agreed order that contained both major violations, the\ncommission treated it as a single major violation for purposes of the repeat violator\ncriteria. The legislative directive of SB 1397 to include all minor, moderate, and major\nviolations requires the removal of the “separate occasion” language to ensure all\nviolations are considered. The change allows the commission to consider all repeat\noccurrences of similar violations documented during the five-year evaluation period\nrather than the number of orders or enforcement actions that contained similar\nviolations.\nProposed §60.2(f)(2)(A) – (C) establishes “repeat violation point” values based on the\nclassification of the violation. Each violation of the same nature and the same\nenvironmental media documented in any final enforcement orders, court judgments,\nand criminal convictions that occurred at least three times during the five-year\ncompliance period is assessed repeat violation points based on the classification of the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 6\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nviolation. Each minor violation receives 2 repeat violation points, each moderate\nviolation receives 10 points, and each major violation receives 50 points. This\nmethodology allows the commission to clearly differentiate between repeat violators\nwith significant actual or potential environmental harm from those entities that have\nrepeat violations with minimal actual or potential environmental harm. For example,\nrepeating a minor violation five times during a five-year period would be equally\nweighted with a single moderate violation, and repeating the same moderate violation\nfive times during a five-year period would be weighted equally to one major violation.\nProposed §60.2(f)(3) establishes repeat violation point thresholds, based on complexity\npoints, to determine repeat violator classifications. Under the proposal, a regulated\nentity is a repeat violator when: the site has less than a total of 15 complexity points\nand 100 or more repeat violation points; or the site has 15 or more complexity points\nand 150 or more repeat violation points. This approach continues to use 15 complexity\npoints as the threshold and expands the criteria for repeat violators from three major\nviolations for higher complex entities (150 points) to a combination of minor,\nmoderate, and major violations (total 150 points) and two major violations for less\ncomplex entities (100 points) to a combination of minor, moderate and major\nviolations (total 100 points). These thresholds ensure that the commission continues\nto hold repeat violators accountable without reducing environmental protections or\nstandards. For example, higher complex regulated entities may reach the threshold by\nrepeating the same moderate violation fifteen times within a five-year period,\nrepeating the same minor violation seventy-five times within a five-year period, or\nsome combination of violation points to reach the 150-point threshold.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 7\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nThe proposal moves \"Repeat Violator Exemption\" from existing §60.2(f)(2) to proposed\n§60.2(f)(4).\nProposed §60.2(g)(1)(L) changes the language referencing the Texas Environmental,\nHealth, and Safety Audit Privilege Act. The Act was amended by the 85th Legislature in\n2017 and the proposed language recognizes this change.\nProposed §60.2(g)(2) changes the site rating ranges for regulated entities. Currently,\nthere is a common set of ranges for entities of all complexities. The commission\nproposes creating separate classification groups based on complexity points to\naddress the Sunset Advisory Commission’s management recommendation to compare\nentities of similar complexity to one another. The proposed rule establishes separate\nranges for higher complex entities and less complex entities. Proposed §60.2(g)(2)(A)\nestablishes the classification rating ranges for regulated entities with a complexity\npoint total less than 15. For a regulated entity classified as less complex, a high\nperformer is defined as having less than 0.10 points. A satisfactory performer is\ndefined as having 0.10 points to 60 points. An unsatisfactory performer is defined as\nhaving more than 60 points.\nProposed §60.2(g)(2)(B) establishes the classification rating ranges for regulated\nentities with a complexity point total of 15 or more. A high performer is defined as\nhaving less than 0.10 points. A satisfactory performer is defined as having 0.10 points\nto 55 points. An unsatisfactory performer is defined as having more than 55 points.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 8\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nAs noted by the Sunset Advisory Commission, the compliance history rule calculation\nmethodology disproportionately impacts less complex entities. The commission\nrecognizes that, in general, less complex entities have fewer resources and face\ndifferent challenges than their higher complexity counterparts. While the higher\ncomplexity entities are generally much larger in size, they tend to have more\nresources, represent a much smaller group of the regulated community, and typically\nhave a potentially larger environmental footprint. The proposed rule allows for\ndifferent classification thresholds for each complexity grouping, thereby accounting\nfor their differences.\nProposed §60.2(g)(3)(A), (B)(i) and (ii) removes the specific point value that a regulated\nentity will receive following the application of a mitigating factor. Should a mitigating\nfactor be granted to a regulated entity, the entity’s rating will be adjusted to the\nmaximum rating within the satisfactory classification for the entity’s complexity point\ngroup. For regulated entities with less than 15 complexity points, the rating will be\nadjusted to 60. For regulated entities with 15 or more complexity points, the rating will\nbe adjusted to 55.\nProposed §60.2(i) revises how a regulated entity can review their pending compliance\nhistory rating to match current practice by removing the submission of a Compliance\nHistory Review Form and replacing it with the registration for the Advanced Review of\nCompliance History (ARCH).\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 9\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nFiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government\nKyle Girten, analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the\nfirst five-year period the proposed rules are in effect, fiscal implications are\nanticipated for TCEQ and fiscal implications may result for units of local government\nas a result of implementation of the proposed rule. No fiscal implications are\nanticipated for other units of state government.\nThe General Appropriations Act (HB 1, 88th Legislature) authorized six full time\nequivalent (FTE) employees and $315,000 in funding to implement statutory changes\nto TWC §5.754 in SB 1397, 88th Legislature, 2023 and directives from the Sunset\nAdvisory Commission that relate to this rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking would\nrequire TCEQ to update its compliance history twice annually instead of once per year\n(§60.2), and the rulemaking would also result in the agency needing to modify its\ncompliance history application. The agency and Advanced Review of Compliance\nHistory website would need to be updated.\nLocal governmental entities which are permittees that are subject to the requirements\nof Chapter 60 could have indirect fiscal impacts from this rulemaking. This rule\napplies to approximately 400,000 entities, and this number includes businesses as well\nas local government entities. Compliance history information must be used by TCEQ\nwhen making decisions regarding permitting, enforcement, announced investigations,\nand participation in innovative programs (§60.3). Should the proposed rulemaking\nresult in a change to whether an entity is classified as a satisfactory/unsatisfactory\nperformer or repeat violator (§60.2), such an entity may have increased or decreased\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 10\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\ncosts associated with permitting or administrative penalties. Ultimately, the fiscal\nimpact on a regulated entity is dependent on compliance or non-compliance with the\napplicable environmental rules and regulations.\nPublic Benefits and Costs\nMr. Girten determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are\nin effect, the public will benefit from having rules that are consistent with state law,\nspecifically SB 1397 from the 88th Regular Legislative Session (2023) and directives\nfrom the Sunset Advisory Commission. The public will also benefit from having a more\nregularly updated record of regulated entities compliance status because the proposed\nrulemaking would require TCEQ to update compliance history information twice\nannually instead of once per year (§60.2).\nBusinesses which are permittees that are subject to the requirements of Chapter 60\ncould have indirect fiscal impacts from this rulemaking. Compliance history\ninformation must be used by TCEQ when making decisions regarding permitting,\nenforcement, announced investigations, and participation in innovative programs\n(§60.3). Should the proposed rulemaking result in a change to whether an entity is\nclassified as a satisfactory/unsatisfactory performer or repeat violator (§60.2), such an\nentity may have increased or decreased costs associated with permitting or\nadministrative penalties. Ultimately, the fiscal impact on a regulated entity is\ndependent on compliance or non-compliance with the applicable environmental rules\nand regulations.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 11\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nLocal Employment Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Local\nEmployment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking does\nnot adversely affect a local economy in a material way for the first five years that the\nproposed rule is in effect.\nRural Community Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first\nfive years that the proposed rules are in effect. The amendments would apply\nstatewide and have the same effect in rural communities as in urban communities.\nSmall Business and Micro-Business Assessment\nNo adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro-businesses due to the\nimplementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period\nthe proposed rules are in effect. Based on directives from the Sunset Advisory\nCommission, the proposed rulemaking is designed to address inequities between small\nand large entities. With the changes proposed in this rulemaking and the creation of\nseparate groups based on complexity points, less complex entities will be separated\nfrom larger, higher complexity entities and compared to similarly complex sites when\ndetermining satisfactory rating classification and repeat violator status. This will allow\neach of the two groups to be held to separate standards which account for the unique\nopportunities and challenges faced by each group.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 12\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Small\nBusiness Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does\nnot adversely affect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nGovernment Growth Impact Statement\nThe commission prepared a Government Growth Impact Statement assessment for this\nproposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a\ngovernment program and will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative\nappropriations to the agency. The proposed rulemaking does not require the creation\nof new employee positions, eliminate current employee positions, nor require an\nincrease or decrease in fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking amends an\nexisting regulation, and it does not create, expand, repeal, or limit this regulation. The\nproposed rulemaking does not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject\nto its applicability. During the first five years, the proposed rule should not impact\npositively or negatively the state’s economy.\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis\nThe commission has reviewed the proposed rulemaking in light of the regulatory\nanalysis requirements of Texas Government Code §2001.0225, and determined that\nthe rulemaking is not subject to §2001.0225 because the proposed rule changes do not\nmeet the definition of a \"Major environmental rule\" as defined in that statute. Although\nthe intent of the proposed rule modifications are to protect the environment and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 13\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nreduce the risk to human health from environmental exposure, they do not adversely\naffect, in a material way, the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,\ncompetition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a\nsector of the state. Instead, the proposed rule changes merely modify the standards for\nthe classification of a person’s compliance history by setting the number of major,\nmoderate, and minor violations needed to be classified as a repeat violator, to review\nand update the agency’s compliance history rating formula to ensure it accurately\nreflects a regulated entity’s record of violations, and to update compliance history\nratings more often than once per fiscal year. The requirements for establishing\nstandards for the classification of a person’s compliance history are contained in TWC\n§5.754.\nThe proposed rule modifications are designed to protect the environment, the public\nhealth, and the public safety of the state and all sectors of the state. Furthermore, the\nproposed rule modifications do not meet any of the four applicability requirements\nlisted in §2001.0225(a). They do not exceed a standard set by federal law, because\nthere is no comparable federal law. They do not exceed an express requirement of\nstate law, because they are consistent with the requirements of TWC, §5.754. The\nproposed rule modifications do not exceed the requirements of a delegation agreement\nbecause there is no applicable delegation agreement. They are not proposed to be\nadopted solely under the general powers of the agency but will be adopted under the\nexpress requirements of TWC §5.754 and management recommendations adopted by\nthe Sunset Advisory Commission.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 14\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nThe commission invites public comment on the draft regulatory impact analysis\ndetermination.\nTakings Impact Assessment\nThe commission evaluated the proposed rules and performed an assessment of\nwhether the proposed rules constitute a taking under TGC, Chapter 2007. The specific\npurpose of the proposed rules is to implement certain requirements of Senate Bill (SB)\n1397 and other legislative directives, regarding compliance history. The proposed rules\nwill substantially advance this stated purpose by modifying the standards for the\nclassification of a person’s compliance history by setting the number of major,\nmoderate, and minor violations needed to be classified as a repeat violator, to review\nand update the agency’s compliance history rating formula to ensure it accurately\nreflects a regulated entity’s record of violations, and to update compliance history\nratings more often than once per fiscal year.\nPromulgation and enforcement of these proposed rules will be neither a statutory nor\na constitutional taking of private real property. Specifically, the subject proposed\nregulations do not affect a landowner's rights in private real property because this\nrulemaking does not burden (constitutionally); nor restrict or limit the owner's right to\nproperty and reduce its value by 25% or more beyond that which would otherwise\nexist in the absence of the regulations. In other words, the proposed rules will not\nburden private real property because they modify the standards for the classification\nof a person’s compliance history by setting the number of major, moderate, and minor\nviolations needed to be classified as a repeat violator, to review and update the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 15\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nagency’s compliance history rating formula to ensure it accurately reflects a regulated\nentity’s record of violations, and to update compliance history ratings more often than\nonce per fiscal year. The subject proposed rules do not affect a landowner’s rights in\nprivate real property.\nConsistency with the Coastal Management Program\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking and found that the proposal is\nsubject to the Texas Coastal Management Program (CMP) in accordance with the\nCoastal Coordination Act, Texas Natural Resources Code, §§33.201 et seq., and\ntherefore must be consistent with all applicable CMP goals and policies. The\ncommission conducted a consistency determination for the proposed rules in\naccordance with Coastal Coordination Act Implementation Rules, 31 TAC §29.22, and\nfound the proposed rulemaking consistent with the applicable CMP goals and policies.\nCMP goals applicable to the proposed rule include: 31 TAC §26.12(1), to protect,\npreserve, restore, and enhance the diversity, quality, quantity, functions, and values of\ncoastal natural resource areas (CNRAs); 31 TAC §26.12(2), to ensure sound\nmanagement of all coastal resources by allowing for compatible economic\ndevelopment and multiple human uses of the coastal zone; 31 TAC §26.12(3), to\nminimize loss of human life and property due to the impairment and loss of protective\nfeatures of CNRAs; 31 TAC §26.12(5), to balance the benefits from economic\ndevelopment and multiple human uses of the coastal zone, the benefits from\nprotecting, preserving, restoring, and enhancing CNRAs, the benefits from minimizing\nloss of human life and property, and the benefits from public access to and enjoyment\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 16\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nof the coastal zone; 31 TAC §26.12(6), to coordinate agency and subdivision decision-\nmaking affecting CNRAs by establishing clear, objective policies for the management\nof CNRAs; 31 TAC §26.12(7), to make agency and subdivision decision-making\naffecting CNRAs efficient by identifying and addressing duplication and conflicts\namong local, state, and federal regulatory and other programs for the management of\nCNRAs; and 31 TAC §26.12(8), to make agency and subdivision decision-making\naffecting CNRAs more effective by employing the most comprehensive, accurate, and\nreliable information and scientific data available and by developing, distributing for\npublic comment, and maintaining a coordinated, publicly accessible geographic\ninformation system of maps of the coastal zone and CNRAs at the earliest possible\ndate. The commission has reviewed the proposed rule for consistency with applicable\ngoals of the CMP and determined that the proposed rule is consistent with the intent\nof the applicable goals and will not result in any significant adverse effect to CNRAs.\nCMP policies applicable to the proposed rule include: 31 TAC §26.19, Construction and\nOperation of Solid Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities; 31 TAC §26.20,\nPrevention, Response, and Remediation of Oil Spills; 31 TAC §26.21, Discharge of\nMunicipal and Industrial Wastewater to Coastal Waters; 31 TAC §26.22, Nonpoint\nSource (NPS) Water Pollution; 31 TAC §26.23, Development in Critical Areas; 31 TAC\n§26.25, Dredging and Dredged Material Disposal and Placement; 31 TAC §26.28,\nDevelopment Within Coastal Barrier Resource System Units and Otherwise Protected\nAreas on Coastal Barriers; and 31 TAC §26.32, Emission of Air Pollutants. This\nrulemaking does not relax existing standards for issuing permits related to the\nconstruction and operation of solid waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities in\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 17\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nthe coastal zone or for governing the prevention of, response to, and remediation of\ncoastal oil spills. This rulemaking does not relax existing commission rules and\nregulations governing the discharge of municipal and industrial wastewater to coastal\nwaters, nor does it affect the requirement that the agency consult with the Department\nof State Health Services regarding wastewater discharges that could significantly\nadversely affect oyster reefs. This rulemaking does not relax the existing requirements\nthat state agencies and subdivisions with the authority to manage NPS pollution\ncooperate in the development and implementation of a coordinated program to reduce\nNPS pollution in order to restore and protect coastal waters. Further, it does not relax\nexisting requirements applicable to: areas with the potential to develop agricultural or\nsilvicultural NPS water quality problems; on-site disposal systems; underground\nstorage tanks; or Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits for stormwater\ndischarges. This rulemaking does not relax the standards related to dredging; the\ndischarge, disposal, and placement of dredge material; compensatory mitigation; and\nauthorization of development in critical areas. This rulemaking does not relax existing\nstandards for issuing permits related to development of infrastructure within Coastal\nBarrier Resource System Units and Otherwise Protected Areas. Rather, the intent of the\nrulemaking is to increase compliance with existing standards and rule requirements.\nPromulgation and enforcement of this rule will not violate or exceed any standards\nidentified in the applicable CMP goals and policies because the proposed rule is\nconsistent with these CMP goals and policies and because this rule does not create or\nhave a direct or significant adverse effect on any coastal natural resource areas.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 18\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nWritten comments on the consistency of this rulemaking may be submitted to the\ncontact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nAnnouncement of Hearing\nThe commission will hold a hold a hybrid virtual and in-person public hearing on this\nproposal in Austin on August 18, 2025, at 10:00am in Building D, Room 191, located at\n12100 Park 35 Circle.

Specifically, for any part of the compliance period that\ninvolves a previous owner, the compliance history will include only the site under\nreview. For the purposes of this rule, a change in operator shall be considered a change\nin ownership if the operator is a co-permittee.\n§60.2. Classification.\n(a) Classifications. [Beginning September 1, 2002] Effective March 1, 2026, the\nexecutive director shall evaluate the compliance history of each site and classify each\nsite and person as needed for the actions listed in §60.1(a)(1) of this title (relating to\nCompliance History). On September 1, 2026 [2003], and semi-annually thereafter, the\nexecutive director shall evaluate the compliance history of each site, and classify each\nsite and person. For the purposes of classification in this chapter, and except with\nregard to portable units, \"site\" means all regulated units, facilities, equipment,\nstructures, or sources at one street address or location that are owned or operated by\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 28\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\nthe same person. Site includes any property identified in the permit or used in\nconnection with the regulated activity at the same street address or location. A \"site\"\nfor a portable regulated unit or facility is any location where the unit or facility is or\nhas operated.

Every site shall be assigned points based upon size as\ndetermined by the following:\n(A) Facility Identification Numbers (FINs): The total number of FINS\nat a site will be multiplied by 0.02 and rounded up to the nearest whole number.\n(B) Water Quality external outfalls:\n(i) 10 points for a site with ten or more external outfalls;\n(ii) 5 points for a site with at least five, but fewer than ten,\nexternal outfalls;\n(iii) 3 points for sites with at least two, but fewer than five,\nexternal outfalls; and\n(iv) 1 point for sites with one external outfall;\n(C) Active Hazardous Waste Management Units (AHWMUs):\n(i) 10 points for sites with 50 or more AHWMUs;\n(ii) 5 points for sites with at least 20, but fewer than 50,\nAHWMUs;\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 36\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(iii) 3 points for sites with at least ten, but fewer than 20,\nAHWMUs; and\n(iv) 1 point for sites with at least one but fewer than ten\nAHWMUs.\n(D) Small Entities shall receive 3 points. A small entity is defined\nas: a city with a population of less than 5,000; a county with a population of less than\n25,000; or a small business. A small business is defined as any person, firm, or\nbusiness which employs, by direct payroll and/or through contract, fewer than 100\nfull-time employees. A business that is a wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation\nshall not qualify as a small business if the parent organization does not qualify as a\nsmall business.\n(E) Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) and Aboveground Storage\nTanks (ASTs):\n(i) 4 points for sites with 11 or more USTs;\n(ii) 3 points for sites with five to ten USTs;\n(iii) 3 points for sites with more than 11 ASTs;\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 37\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(iv) 2 points for sites with three to four USTs;\n(v) 2 points for sites with three to ten, ASTs;\n(vi) 1 point for sites with one to two USTs; and\n(vii) 1 point for sites with one to two ASTs.\n(3) Nonattainment area points. Every site located in a nonattainment area\nshall be assigned 1 point.\n(4) The subtotals from paragraphs (1) - (3) of this subsection shall be\nsummed.\n(f) Repeat violator.\n(1) Repeat violator criteria. A person may be classified as a repeat violator\nat a site when [, on] multiple [, separate occasions,] major, moderate, or minor\nviolations of the same nature and the same environmental media occurs during the\npreceding five-year compliance period [as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this\nparagraph]. Same nature is defined as violations that have the same root citation at the\nsubsection level. For example, all rules under §334.50 of this title (relating to Release\nDetection) (e.g. §334.50(a) or (b)(2) of this title) would be considered same nature. The\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 38\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\ntotal complexity points for a site equals the sum of points assigned to a specific site in\nsubsection (e) of this section. [A person is a repeat violator at a site when:]\n[(A) the site has had a major violation(s) documented on at least\ntwo occasions and has less than a total of 15 complexity points; or]\n[(B) the site has had a major violation(s) documented on at least\nthree occasions.]\n(2) Repeat violation points. Each repeat violation will be:\n(A) Assigned 2 points for each minor violation as documented in\nany final enforcement orders, court judgments, and criminal convictions;\n(B) Assigned 10 points for each moderate violation as documented\nin any final enforcement orders, court judgments, and criminal convictions; and\n(C) Assigned 50 points for each major violation as documented in\nany final enforcement orders, court judgments, and criminal convictions.\n(3) A person is a repeat violator at a site when the number of repeat\nviolation points is:\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 39\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(A) Equal to or greater than 150 for sites with 15 or more\ncomplexity points; or,\n(B) Equal to or greater than 100 for sites with less than 15\ncomplexity points.\n(4) [(2)] Repeat violator exemption. The executive director shall designate\na person as a repeat violator as provided in this subsection, unless the executive\ndirector determines the nature of the violations and the conditions leading to the\nviolations do not warrant the designation.\n(g) Formula. The executive director shall determine a site rating based upon the\nfollowing method.\n(1) Site rating. For the time period reviewed, the following calculations\nshall be performed based upon the compliance history at the site.\n(A) The number of major violations contained in:\n(i) any adjudicated final court judgments and default\njudgments, shall be multiplied by 160;\n(ii) any non-adjudicated final court judgments or consent\ndecrees without a denial of liability shall be multiplied by 140;\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 40\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(iii) any non-adjudicated final court judgments or consent\ndecrees containing a denial of liability, adjudicated final enforcement orders, and\ndefault orders, shall be multiplied by 120;\n(iv) any final prohibitory emergency orders issued by the\ncommission shall be multiplied by 120;\n(v) any agreed final enforcement orders without a denial of\nliability shall be multiplied by 100; and\n(vi) any agreed final enforcement orders containing a denial\nof liability shall be multiplied by 80.\n(B) The number of moderate violations contained in:\n(i) any adjudicated final court judgments and default\njudgments shall be multiplied by 115;\n(ii) any non-adjudicated final court judgments or consent\ndecrees without a denial of liability shall be multiplied by 95;\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 41\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(iii) any non-adjudicated final court judgments or consent\ndecrees containing a denial of liability, adjudicated final enforcement orders, and\ndefault orders, shall be multiplied by 75;\n(iv) any agreed final enforcement orders without a denial of\nliability shall be multiplied by 60; and\n(v) any agreed final enforcement orders containing a denial\nof liability shall be multiplied by 45.\n(C) The number of minor violations contained in:\n(i) any adjudicated final court judgments and default\njudgments shall be multiplied by 45;\n(ii) any non-adjudicated final court judgments or consent\ndecrees without a denial of liability shall be multiplied by 35;\n(iii) any non-adjudicated final court judgments or consent\ndecrees containing a denial of liability, adjudicated final enforcement orders, and\ndefault orders, shall be multiplied by 25;\n(iv) any agreed final enforcement orders without a denial of\nliability shall be multiplied by 20; and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 42\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(v) any agreed final enforcement orders containing a denial\nof liability shall be multiplied by 15.\n(D) The total number of points assigned for all resolved violations\nin subparagraphs (A) - (C) of this paragraph will be reduced based on achievement of\ncompliance with all ordering provisions. For the first two years after the effective date\nof the enforcement order(s), court judgment(s), consent decree(s), and criminal\nconviction(s), the site will receive the total number of points assigned for violations in\nsubparagraphs (A) - (C) of this paragraph. If all violations in subparagraphs (A) - (C) of\nthis paragraph are resolved and compliance with all ordering provisions is achieved,\nfor each enforcement order(s), court judgment(s), consent decree(s), and criminal\nconviction(s) :\n(i) under two years old, the points associated with the\nviolations in subparagraphs (A) - (C) of this paragraph will be multiplied by 1.0;\n(ii) over two years old, the points associated with the\nviolations in subparagraphs (A) - (C) of this paragraph will be multiplied by 0.75;\n(iii) over three years old, the points associated with the\nviolations in subparagraphs (A) - (C) of this paragraph will be multiplied by 0.50; and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 43\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(iv) over four years old, the points associated with the\nviolations in subparagraphs (A) - (C) of this paragraph will be multiplied by 0.25.\n(E) The number of major violations contained in any notices of\nviolation shall be multiplied by 10.\n(F) The number of moderate violations contained in any notices of\nviolation shall be multiplied by 4.\n(G) The number of minor violations contained in any notices of\nviolation shall be multiplied by 1.\n(H) The number of counts in all criminal convictions:\n(i) under Texas Water Code (TWC), §§7.145, 7.152, 7.153,\n7.162(a)(1) - (5), 7.163(a)(1) - (3), 7.164, 7.168 - 7.170, 7.176, 7.182, 7.183, and all felony\nconvictions under the Texas Penal Code, TWC, Texas Health and Safety Code (THSC), or\nthe United States Code (USC) shall be multiplied by 500; and\n(ii) under TWC, §§7.147 - 7.151, 7.154, 7.157, 7.159, 7.160,\n7.162(a)(6) - (8), 7.163(a)(4), 7.165 - 7.167, 7.171, 7.177 - 7.181, and all misdemeanor\nconvictions under the Texas Penal Code, TWC, THSC, or the USC shall be multiplied by\n250.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 44\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(I) The number of chronic excessive emissions events shall be\nmultiplied by 100.\n(J) The subtotals from subparagraphs (A) - (I) of this paragraph\nshall be summed.\n(K) If the person is a repeat violator as determined under\nsubsection (f) of this section, then 500 points shall be added to the total in\nsubparagraph (J) of this paragraph. If the person is not a repeat violator as determined\nunder subsection (f) of this section, then zero points shall be added to the total in\nsubparagraph (J) of this paragraph.\n(L) If the total in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph is greater than\nzero, then:\n(i) subtract 1 point from the total in subparagraph (K) of\nthis paragraph for each notice of an intended audit conducted under the Audit Act\nsubmitted to the agency during the compliance period; or\n(ii) if a violation(s) was disclosed as a result of an audit\nconducted under the Audit Act [Texas Environmental, Health, and Safety Audit\nPrivilege Act, (Audit Act), 75th Legislature, 1997, TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art.4447cc\n(Vernon's)]; as amended, and the site received immunity from an administrative or civil\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 45\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\npenalty for that violation(s) by the agency, then the following number(s) shall be\nsubtracted from the total in subparagraph (K) of this paragraph:\n(I) the number of major violations multiplied by 10;\n(II) the number of moderate violations multiplied by\n4; and\n(III) the number of minor violations multiplied by 1.\n(M) The result of the calculations in subparagraphs (J) - (L) of this\nparagraph shall be divided by the number of investigations conducted during the\ncompliance period multiplied by 0.1 plus the number of complexity points in\nsubsection (e) of this section. If a site does not have any investigation points and the\nsubtotal from subsection (e)(1) - (3) of this section equals zero, then one default point\nshall be used. Investigations that do not document any violations will be the only ones\ncounted in the compliance history formula. The number of investigations multiplied by\n0.1 shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. If the value is less than zero,\nthen the site rating shall be assigned a value of zero. For the purposes of this chapter,\nan investigation is a review or evaluation of information by the executive director or\nexecutive director's staff or agent regarding the compliance status of a site, excluding\nthose investigations initiated by citizen complaints. An investigation, for the purposes\nof this chapter, may take the form of a site assessment, file or record review,\ncompliance investigation, or other review or evaluation of information.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 46\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(N) If the person receives certification of an environmental\nmanagement system (EMS) under Chapter 90 of this title (relating to Innovative\nPrograms) and has implemented the EMS at the site for more than one year, then\nmultiply the result in subparagraph (M) of this paragraph by 0.90, which is (1 - 0.10)\nand this is the maximum reduction that can be received for an EMS. If the person\nreceives credit for a voluntary pollution reduction program or for early compliance,\nthen multiply the result in subparagraph (M) of this paragraph by 0.95, which is (1 -\n0.05). The maximum reduction that a site's compliance history may be reduced\nthrough voluntary pollution reduction programs in this subparagraph is 0.85, which is\n(1 - 0.15). If site participates in both EMS and voluntary pollution reduction programs\nthen the maximum reduction that a site's compliance history may be reduced through\nEMS and voluntary programs in this subparagraph is 0.75, which is (1 - 0.10 - 0.15).\n(2) Point ranges. The executive director shall assign the site a\nclassification based upon the compliance history and application of the formula in\nparagraph (1) of this subsection to determine a site rating, utilizing the following site\nrating ranges for each classification:\n(A) For entities with less than 15 complexity points:\n(i) [A] fewer than 0.10 points--high performer;\n(ii) 0.10 points to 60 points--satisfactory performer; and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 47\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(iii) more than 60 points--unsatisfactory performer.\n(B) For entities with 15 or more complexity points:\n(i) fewer than 0.10 points--high performer;\n(ii) [B] 0.10 points to 55 points—satisfactory performer; and\n(iii) [C] more than 55 points—unsatisfactory performer.\n(3) Mitigating factors. The executive director shall evaluate mitigating\nfactors for a site classified as an unsatisfactory performer.\n(A) The executive director may reclassify the site from\nunsatisfactory to satisfactory performer [with 55 points] based upon the following\nmitigating factors:\n(i) other compliance history components included in\n§60.1(c)(10) - (12) of this title;\n(ii) implementation of an EMS not certified under Chapter\n90 of this title at a site for more than one year;\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 48\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(iii) a person, all of whose other sites have a high or\nsatisfactory performer classification, purchased a site with an unsatisfactory\nperformer classification or became permitted to operate a site with an unsatisfactory\nperformer classification if the person entered into a compliance agreement with the\nexecutive director regarding actions to be taken to bring the site into compliance prior\nto the effective date of this rule; and\n(iv) voluntarily reporting a violation to the executive\ndirector that is not otherwise required to be reported and that is not reported under\nthe Audit Act, or that is reported under the Audit Act but is not granted immunity\nfrom an administrative or civil penalty for that violation(s) by the agency.\n(B) When a person, all of whose other sites have a high or\nsatisfactory performer classification, purchased a site with an unsatisfactory\nperformer classification or became permitted to operate a site with an unsatisfactory\nperformer classification and the person contemporaneously entered into a compliance\nagreement with the executive director regarding actions to be taken to bring the site\ninto compliance, the executive director:\n(i) shall reclassify the site from unsatisfactory performer to\nsatisfactory performer [with 55 points] until such time as the next annual compliance\nhistory classification is performed; and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 49\nChapter 60 - Compliance History\nRule Project No. 2024-043-060-CE\n(ii) may, at the time of subsequent compliance history\nclassifications, reclassify the site from unsatisfactory performer to satisfactory\nperformer [with 55 points] based upon the executive director's evaluation of the\nperson's compliance with the terms of the compliance agreement.\n(h) Person classification. The executive director shall assign a classification to a\nperson by adding the complexity weighted site ratings of all the sites owned and/or\noperated by that person in the State of Texas. Each site that a person is affiliated to\nwill receive a point value based on the compliance history rating at the site multiplied\nby the percentage of complexity points that site represents of the person's total\ncomplexity points for all sites. Each of these calculated amounts will be added together\nto determine the person's compliance history rating.\n(i) Notice of classifications. Notice of person and site classifications shall be\nposted on the commission's website after 30 days from the completion of the\nclassification. The notice of classification shall undergo a quality assurance, quality\ncontrol review period. An owner or operator of a site may review the pending\ncompliance history rating upon request by registering for the Advanced Review of\nCompliance History.

    "full_text": "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 1\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission) proposes new\n§§101.700 - 101.718\nThe proposed new sections will be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)\nas revisions to the state implementation plan (SIP).\nBackground and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules\nFederal Clean Air Act (FCAA), §182(d)(3) and (e) and §185 (Section 185, generally) require the\nSIP to include a rule that implements a penalty fee (Section 185 fee, Failure to Attain Fee, fee)\nfor major stationary sources (major sources) of volatile organic compounds (VOC) located in an\nozone nonattainment area classified as severe or extreme if that area fails to attain the ozone\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard) by the applicable attainment date.\nFCAA, §182(f) states that requirements \"for major stationary sources of volatile organic\ncompounds shall also apply to major stationary sources (as defined in §7602 of this title and\nsubsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section) of oxides of nitrogen (NO ).\" This FCAA requirement\nX\nextends the Section 185 fee assessment to major stationary sources of NO emissions. The SIP\nX\nmust also include procedures for the assessment and collection of the penalty fee. If the state\ndoes not impose and collect the fee, then FCAA, §185(d) requires that EPA impose and collect\nthe fee with interest, and the revenue is not returned to the state.\nFor the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard of 0.75 parts per million, on October 7, 2022, EPA\npublished a final notice that reclassified the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Houston-Galveston-\nBrazoria (HGB) 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas from serious to severe effective\nNovember 7, 2022 (87 Federal Register (FR) 60926). The DFW severe nonattainment area\nconsists of 10 counties: Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall,\nTarrant, and Wise. The HGB severe nonattainment area consists of eight counties: Brazoria,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nChambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller. The DFW and HGB\nsevere nonattainment areas are required to attain the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard by July\n20, 2027. If a severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area does not attain by the attainment\ndate, the area will be subject to the penalty fee requirements upon EPA issuing a finding of\nfailure to attain for the area. For fee assessment purposes, the 2027 calendar year from January\n1, 2027, through December 31, 2027, is anticipated to be the baseline year for these severe\nnonattainment areas since it is the year that contains the attainment date. The penalty fee is\nrequired to be paid until EPA redesignates the area as attainment for the 2008 eight-hour ozone\nstandard or EPA takes action that results in termination of the fee.\nAs stated in FCAA, §182(d)(3) and (e) and §185, the required penalty is $5,000 per ton, as\nadjusted for inflation by the consumer price index (CPI), of VOC and/or NO emissions emitted\nX\nin excess of 80% of a major stationary source’s baseline amount. A baseline amount would be\ndetermined for each pollutant, VOC and/or NO , for which the source meets the major source\nX\napplicability requirements. A source that is major for VOC emissions would be subject to the\nfee on VOC emissions; a source that is major for NO emissions would be subject to the fee on\nX\nNO emissions; and a source that is major for both VOC and NO emissions would be subject to\nX X\nthe fee on both VOC and NO emissions.\nX\nThe major stationary source’s fixed baseline amount is proposed to be calculated as the lower\nof the baseline emissions or total annual authorized emissions during the baseline year; the\nbaseline amount must be adjusted downward to account for unauthorized emissions and/or\nemissions limitations in effect as of December 31 of the baseline year or timeframe used to\ndetermine the baseline amount. The major stationary source’s baseline emissions are defined as\nthe annual routine emissions reported to the TCEQ point source emissions inventory (emissions\ninventory) according to 30 TAC §101.10, excluding emissions not authorized by permit or rule,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 3\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nsuch as emissions from emissions events and scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, startup,\nand shutdown (MSS) activities. The major stationary source’s authorized emissions include\nemissions allowed under any EPA or TCEQ-enforceable measure or document, such as rules,\nregulations, permits, orders of the commission, and/or court orders.\nThe proposed rule allows for a baseline amount determination with flexibilities such as\naggregating pollutants (VOC and NO emissions) and aggregating sites under common\nX\nownership and control into a single baseline. The proposed rule also allows for baseline amount\ndeterminations when a period other than the baseline year may be required, such as new major\nstationary sources that began operating after the baseline year or major stationary sources with\nemissions that are irregular, cyclic, or vary significantly from year to year. Under specific\ncircumstances, as proposed, major stationary sources may request adjustments to the fixed\nbaseline amount. The estimated maximum Section 185 fee without baseline amount flexibilities\nand alternative revenue for both the HGB and DFW severe ozone nonattainment areas would be\nover $200 million per year.\nTCEQ proposes a program under FCAA, §172(e) with flexibility aspects not directly described in\nFCAA, §185, including but not limited to alternative revenue and baseline aggregation.\nAlthough EPA has not issued guidance to assist states with developing Section 185 fee\nprograms under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, in its 2010 guidance (available\nat: http://www.epa.gov/glo/pdfs/20100105185guidance.pdf), multiple approvals of similar\nequivalent alternative programs in California and New York, and in a final rule published in the\nFebruary 14, 2020, Federal Register (85 FR 8411) for the Section 185 Fee Program in the HGB\nnonattainment area under the one-hour ozone standard (HGB Failure to Attain Fee), EPA\napproved the use of equivalent programs to fulfill the FCAA, §185 fee requirement. Although\nthe 2010 guidance was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on procedural grounds,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 4\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nEPA continued to utilize the principles outlined in the guidance as support for its approvals of\nequivalent alternative programs, NRDC v. EPA, 643 F.3d 311 (D.C. Cir. July 2011). Notably, the\ncourt did not prohibit alternative programs, instead stating that “neither the statute nor our\ncase law obviously precludes that alternative.” In the absence of formal EPA guidance for\nSection 185 fee programs under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, this proposed rulemaking\nrelied on the 2010 guidance to develop Texas’ fee program. In the HGB Failure to Attain Fee\nfinal approval, EPA approved fee programs funded to reduce VOC and NO emissions that are\nX\nqualified programs, surplus to the one-hour ozone SIP, and designed to result in direct\nreductions or facilitate future reductions of VOC or NO emissions, which is consistent with the\nX\nprinciples of the anti-backsliding principle of the FCAA §172(e). EPA’s 2010 guidance requires\nan equivalent alternative program to achieve the same emissions reductions, raise the same\namount of revenue and establish a process by which penalty funds would be used to pay for\nemission reductions that would further improve ozone air quality, or a combination of\nemissions reductions or revenue collection.\nEPA states in its 2010 guidance that it may allow alternative programs for which \"the proceeds\nare spent to pay for emissions reductions of ozone-forming pollutants (NO and/or VOC) in the\nX\nsame geographic area subject to the §185 program.\" EPA further states, \"Under this concept,\nstates could develop programs that shift the fee burden from the specific set of major\nstationary sources that are otherwise required to pay fees according to §185, to other non-\nmajor sources of emissions, including owners/operators of mobile sources.\" From these\nstatements and EPA’s final approval of the HGB Failure to Attain Fee, located in 30 Texas\nAdministrative Code (TAC) 101 Subchapter B, EPA supports equivalent alternative options to a\nfee-based program provided the option is \"no-less stringent\" than a strict fee-based program\nand generally meets the stated criteria for the (now revoked) one-hour ozone standard. EPA\napproved other equivalent alternative programs pursuant to the 2010 guidance for the one-\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 5\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nhour ozone standard including San Joaquin Valley (77 FR 50021), South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District, (77 FR 74372), and the New York portion of the New York-Northern New\nJersey-Long Island nonattainment area (84 FR 12511). EPA’s approvals of these Section 185 fee\nprograms under the one-hour ozone standard included alternative fee revenue by assessing a\nfee on mobile sources. The revenue was used to offset the fee due from major stationary\nsources in the nonattainment areas. EPA’s prior approvals were based on its current\ninterpretation that FCAA, §172(e) allows equivalent alternative fee programs for revoked ozone\nstandards. However, nothing in FCAA, §172(e) prohibits equivalent alternative fee programs for\nactive ozone standards and therefore the commission proposes an equivalent alternative fee\nprogram in this rule.\nThe HGB Failure to Attain Fee Rule allowed revenue collected from the HGB one-hour ozone\nstandard nonattainment area for qualified programs that directly reduced VOC or\nNO emissions to offset the FCAA, §185 fee. No actual revenue or funding was transferred to\nX\nthe program; the funds were calculated, recorded, and assessed to ensure a sufficient amount\nwas collected to offset the required Section 185 fee amount. The same approach is used for this\nproposed rulemaking.\nAlthough EPA has not issued guidance to assist states with developing Section 185 fee\nprograms under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, EPA originally described certain basic\nprinciples concerning the applicability of the FCAA, §182(d)(3) and (e) and §185 fee for severe\nor extreme ozone nonattainment areas under the one-hour ozone standard. In a final rule\npublished November 16, 2005, in the Federal Register (70 FR 69440) regarding the Maryland\nportion of the Washington, D.C. severe one-hour ozone nonattainment area, EPA noted in\nresponse to a comment that \"Section 185 of the Act simply requires that the SIP contain a\nprovision that major stationary sources within a severe or extreme nonattainment area pay a\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 6\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nfee to the state as a penalty for failure of that area to attain the ozone NAAQS by the area’s\nattainment date. This penalty fee is based on the tons of volatile organic compound or nitrogen\noxide emitted above a source-specific trigger level during the ‘attainment year.’ It [the fee] first\ncomes due for emissions during the calendar year beginning after the attainment date and must\nbe paid annually until the area is redesignated to attainment of the ozone NAAQS. Thus, if a\nsevere area, with an attainment date of November 15, 2005, fails to attain by that date, the first\npenalty assessment will be assessed in calendar year 2006 for emissions that exceed 80% of the\nsource’s 2005 baseline emissions\" (70 FR 69440, 69441). The same rationale was used to\nestablish the anticipated baseline year of 2027 for the DFW and HGB severe nonattainment\nareas under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard.\nEPA further states that a \"penalty fee that is based on emissions could have some incidental\neffect on emissions if sources decrease their emissions to reduce the amount of the per ton\nmonetary penalty. However, the penalty fee does not ensure that any actual emissions\nreduction will ever occur since every source can pay a penalty rather than achieve actual\nemissions reductions. The provision’s plain language evinces an intent to penalize emissions in\nexcess of a threshold by way of a fee; it does not have as a stated purpose the goal of emissions\nreductions\" (70 FR 69440, 69441 - 69442). Major stationary sources may elect to reduce their\nemissions to reduce the fee owed, or they may elect to pay the fee without reducing their\nemissions.\nEPA also previously issued guidance (Guidance on Establishing Baselines under Section 185 of\nthe Clean Air Act (CAA) for Severe and Extreme Ozone Nonattainment Areas that Fail to Attain\nthe 1-hour Ozone NAAQS by their Attainment) on March 21, 2008 (available\nat www.epa.gov/ttn/caaa/t1/memoranda/20080321_harnett_emissions_basline.pdf), regarding\nestablishing emission baseline amounts. The March 21, 2008, guidance memo discussed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 7\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nalternative methods for calculating the baseline amount, as permitted by FCAA, §185. EPA\nnoted that in some cases, baseline amounts may not be representative of normal operating\nconditions because a source’s emissions may be irregular, cyclic, or otherwise vary significantly\nfrom year to year. This concept would be applicable regardless of the fee program implemented\nor the ozone standard requiring the fee program.\nEPA indicated in its guidance that relying on its regulations for Prevention of Significant\nDeterioration (PSD) of Air Quality, which are found in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)\n§52.21(b)(48), would be an acceptable alternative method for calculating the baseline amount.\nUnder the PSD rules, sources may use emissions data from any period of 24 consecutive\nmonths within the previous ten years (a two-in-ten look back period) to calculate an average\nannual actual emissions rate. EPA determined the two-in-ten look back period to be reasonable\nbecause it allows sources to consider an average emissions rate for a full business cycle.\nThe PSD rules modify this concept for electrical utility steam generating units to 24 consecutive\nmonths within the previous five years (a two-in-five look back period) due to a shorter business\ncycle for those units. The commission agrees that use of the two-in-ten and two-in-five look-\nback periods is reasonable for sources for which emissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise\nvary significantly from year to year, and the commission proposes to provide this option in the\nsame manner as provided for in the Texas New Source Review Program. Since the PSD guidance\nis specific to sources for which emissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly\nfrom year to year, the averaging option would not be available for sources with steady-state\noperations.\nA variability analysis on sites reporting to the TCEQ point source emissions inventory was\nperformed to determine if VOC and NO emissions were variable over the twelve-year period\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 8\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nbetween 2011 (the base year for the 2008 ozone standard) through 2022 (the most recent\ncomplete point source emissions inventory at the time this analysis was performed) for the\nDFW and HGB severe nonattainment areas. Data for the DFW and HGB variability analysis were\nanalyzed separately for VOC and NO emissions. Sites that reported mean 2011 through 2022\nX\nemissions greater than 20 tons per year in the TCEQ emissions inventory were included in this\nanalysis.\nA site’s emissions were determined to be variable if the following formula was true, where x =\nVOC or NO emissions and σ = one standard deviation of the data set:\nX\nFigure 1: Formula for Emissions Variability Determination\n𝑥 > 𝑥 + 𝜎\n𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑 2011−2022 2011−2022\nVariability of reported NO and VOC emissions ranged from 3% to 128% in the HGB area and\nX\nfrom 0.1% to 265% in the DFW area over the twelve years examined. Fifty-nine percent or 162 of\nthe 274 NO and/or VOC emissions sources in the HGB area were variable as defined by the\nX\nabove formula. Forty-eight percent or 115 of the 238 NO and/or VOC emissions sources in the\nX\nDFW area were variable as defined by the above formula.\nThe variability analysis shows that a high level of source-level emissions variability occurred\nbetween 2011 and 2022 in the DFW and HGB severe nonattainment areas; therefore, it is\nappropriate to use a 24-month period during the previous ten years (or five years if the source\nis an electric utility steam generating unit) to establish a baseline for the FCAA, §185 fee\nprogram.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 9\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nBased on the analysis above, the commission proposes to use EPA’s baseline guidance and\nEPA’s long-standing PSD regulations for sources with emissions that are irregular, cyclic, or\notherwise vary significantly to offer an option for these source types to establish a baseline\namount. Since FCAA, §185 states that the baseline amounts may be adjusted for these types of\nsources if the EPA Administrator issues guidance, the commission has proposed these\nprovisions based on these EPA guidance documents.\nLike the HGB Failure to Attain Fee Rule, the commission proposes to use the Texas Emissions\nReduction Plan (TERP) revenue from each area collected after the 2008 eight-hour ozone\nattainment (baseline) year to offset the area’s FCAA, §185 fee obligation.\nThe objectives of TERP are specifically described in statute and are consistent with EPA’s\nobjective for an equivalent FCAA, §185 fee program. TERP program objectives, listed in Texas\nHealth and Safety Code (THSC), §386.052, address \"achieving maximum reduction in oxides of\nnitrogen to demonstrate compliance with the state implementation plans\" and \"advancing new\ntechnologies that reduce oxides of nitrogen from facilities and other stationary sources.\" TERP,\nas described in THSC, §386.053, is restricted to having \"safeguards that ensure that funded\nprojects generate emissions reductions not otherwise required by state or federal law.\"\nTCEQ implements TERP to reduce NO emissions, a precursor to ozone pollution. TERP grant\nX\nprograms provide financial incentives to individuals, state and local governments, corporations,\nand other legal entities to upgrade or replace their older, higher emitting vehicles and\nequipment with newer, cleaner vehicles and equipment. The TERP programs also encourage the\nuse of alternative fuels for transportation in Texas, and the implementation of new\ntechnologies that reduce emissions from stationary sources and oil and gas operations.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 10\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nIn the DFW severe nonattainment area, mobile source NO emissions are the single-largest\nX\ncategory of the 2023 emissions inventory at 65%. In the HGB severe nonattainment area, mobile\nsource NO emissions are the single-largest category of the 2023 emissions inventory at 55%.\nX\nThe emissions reduction grant programs that TERP funds decrease ozone precursor emissions\nmore directly than a penalty fee assessed on major stationary sources. The commission\nproposes rules to credit the TERP revenue collected as an equivalent approach because TERP\nmeets one of the three types of alternative programs that satisfy the requirements addressed in\nEPA’s 2010 guidance memo. The grant programs funded through TERP are the same or similar\nprograms that EPA previously approved as meeting the requirements for FCAA, §185 fee\nprogram equivalency under the HGB Failure to Attain Fee Rule.\nFees and surcharges related to the sale and use of vehicles and heavy-duty equipment in Texas\nfund the TERP programs. TCEQ would credit all revenue allocated for TERP programs and\nadministration. TCEQ would identify and track TERP revenue generated from the DFW severe\nnonattainment area and the HGB severe nonattainment area in two separate Fee Equivalency\nAccounts to demonstrate equivalency of the area-specific TERP revenue to the penalty fee owed\nby major stationary sources located in that area.\nUnder the proposed rules, the commission would be required to annually estimate the expected\nArea §185 Obligation and compare this estimation with the expected TERP revenue. The\ncommission proposes that TERP revenue collected after the attainment year (baseline year) and\nstatutorily available for TERP programs would be credited towards meeting the FCAA, §185 fee\nobligation. For the DFW and HGB 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas, 2027 is the\nattainment year (baseline year) contained in the July 20, 2027, attainment date. Barring any\nextension to the attainment date, any TERP revenue generated from the nonattainment area\nstarting with 2028 that is statutorily available for TERP programs could be credited to meet the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 11\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nArea §185 Obligation for DFW and HGB 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas.\nTo obtain the estimated total FCAA, §185 fee due from all major stationary sources, a baseline\namount would be established for each major stationary source (or group of sources under a\nSection 185 Account, if aggregated as proposed and discussed later in this preamble) within the\nDFW 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area or located within the HGB 2008 eight-hour\nozone nonattainment area. The two nonattainment areas are assessed separately, resulting in\ntwo Area §185 Obligations, one for DFW and one for HGB. Each major stationary source’s or\nSection 185 Account’s reported baseline amount(s) and actual emissions would be used to\ncalculate a Failure to Attain Fee. The resulting amount due from each major stationary source\nor Section 185 Account for aggregated sources would be summed by location to determine the\noverall DFW and HGB 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area’s Area §185 Obligations.\nIf revenue generated from TERP is insufficient to fully offset the Area §185 Obligation for the\nDFW 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area or HGB area 2008 eight-hour ozone\nnonattainment, then the remaining difference would be assessed as a Failure to Attain Fee on a\nmajor stationary source or Section 185 Account for the area on a prorated basis. The amount\ncollected from each major stationary source or Section 185 Account would be discounted based\non the amount of revenue credited to the Fee Equivalency Account. In this manner, these\nproposed rules would \"backstop\" any TERP revenue with fees directly assessed on major\nstationary sources as necessary to meet each year’s fee. The Area §185 Obligation would be\nfully met either through the demonstration from the Fee Equivalency Account or, if necessary,\nsupplemented with directly assessed fees on major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts.\nThis method of fee equivalency is no \"less stringent\" than a direct fee program required by\nFCAA, §185.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 12\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nTo determine a major stationary source’s baseline amount and the Failure to Attain Fee that\nwould apply to each major stationary source, the commission proposes to provide major\nstationary sources a choice to individually determine baselines for VOC and NO emissions,\nX\naggregate VOC and NO emissions into one baseline if the source is major for both pollutants,\nX\nor aggregate those emissions across multiple major stationary sources under common control.\nIn Attachment C of EPA’s 2010 guidance memo, EPA states it would \". . . allow for aggregation\nof sources. We anticipate that we would be able to approve a FCAA, §185 fee program SIP that\nrelies on a definition of ‘major stationary source’ that is consistent with the FCAA as\ninterpreted in our existing regulations and policies.\" EPA’s 2010 memo further states that EPA\nwould allow aggregation of VOC with NO emissions, \". . . provided that the aggregation is not\nX\nused to avoid a ‘major source’ applicability finding, and aggregation is consistent with the\nattainment demonstration . . . we believe states have a discretion to allow a major source to\naggregate VOC and NO emissions.\" The proposed rulemaking would require a major stationary\nX\nsource to first determine its major source applicability for both VOC and NO emissions. In this\nX\napproach, a major stationary source cannot use aggregation to avoid applicability of the FCAA,\n§185 fee rule. If the major stationary source chooses to aggregate baselines by pollutant or site\nor both, it would be required to provide to TCEQ the individual, unaggregated pollutant and site\nbaselines for each pollutant(s) that determines major source status. This will ensure that staff\ncan accurately enter aggregated baseline amounts into the TCEQ’s Section 185 fee database.\nIn making determinations of whether common control exists, the commission would consider\nEPA guidance regarding common control. For example, in a final rule on the Requirements for\nPreparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans; Emissions Offset Interpretive\nRuling (45 FR 59878, September 11, 1980), EPA stated it would determine control guided by the\ngeneral definition of control used by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In SEC\nconsiderations of control, control \"means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 13\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\ndirect or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person whether through the\nownership of voting shares, contract, or otherwise\" (17 CFR §210.1 and §210.2(g)). EPA\ngenerally continues to assess common control based on the general principles outlined above\nand has periodically issued additional guidance for specific topics such as how to assess\ncontiguous or adjacent properties, industrial grouping, etc. The commission would also use\nother criteria to determine common control consistent with participation in local area banking\nprograms, such as the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade or the Highly-Reactive Volatile Organic\nCompound Cap and Trade programs. A group of major stationary sources choosing to\naggregate under common control as a single customer would be identified with a single\ncommon customer identifier used by the commission, the customer number (CN). A group of\nmajor stationary sources under common control would be assigned a single Section 185\nAccount number by TCEQ.\nSince VOC and NO emissions reductions are both effective at lowering ozone concentrations in\nX\nboth the DFW and HGB 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas, major sources should be\nallowed to aggregate both NO and VOC emissions into one baseline amount. The commission\nX\nadopted a strategy of targeting those pollutants in a way that would allow ozone nonattainment\nareas to attain the standard as expeditiously as practicable in the applicable attainment\ndemonstration SIPs. States are required by the FCAA to assess and develop strategies for\nnonattainment areas, as part of the SIP revision process, to achieve attainment and maintenance\nof the standard, and this approach is a result of the knowledge gained from research and\ndetailed photochemical modeling of each nonattainment area. The commission’s proposed\nflexibility option to allow aggregation of VOC and NO as well as major stationary source\nX\naggregation for both pollutants continues to support the strategies outlined in the attainment\ndemonstration SIPs. This proposed aggregation method compliments the multi-pollutant\ncontrol strategies incorporated into the SIP for the DFW and HGB ozone nonattainment areas.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 14\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nAs addressed previously, FCAA, §185 requires the SIP to include a requirement for the\nimposition of a penalty fee on major stationary sources of emissions of VOC in a severe or\nextreme ozone area that failed to attain the standard by its applicable due date. FCAA, §182(f)\nstates that requirements \"for major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds shall also\napply to major stationary sources (as defined in §7602 of this title and subsections (c), (d), and\n(e) of this section) of oxides of nitrogen.\" Thus, the requirement to assess a fee on major\nstationary sources of NO emissions is also required. This language in FCAA, §182(f) does not\nX\nexplicitly state that requirements for NO sources are to be held separate from those for VOC\nX\nbut are \"also required\" for sources of NO emissions. Both VOC and NO control strategies have\nX X\na common goal: to reduce ozone-forming emissions. The stated objective of FCAA, §182(f) and\n§185 is to assess a fee for VOC and NO emissions on major stationary sources emitting above\nX\na certain baseline amount of emissions. The Section 185 per ton fee rate required for the\npollutants remains the same regardless of whether the pollutant is VOC or NO and thus, there\nX\nis no reason to require that a fee be assessed separately for each pollutant. The commission\nproposes to allow a major stationary source to combine these emissions for baseline amount\ndeterminations and fee assessments providing that specified criteria are met to ensure\nconsistency.\nAdditionally, the commission notes that EPA guidance allows for NO substitution in its\nX\nreasonable further progress (RFP) SIP revisions as further support for allowing VOC and NO\nX\nemissions to be aggregated for both baseline amount determinations and fee assessments. In\nits December 1993 NO Substitution Guidance (available\nX\nat http://www.epa.gov/ttncaaa1/t1/memoranda/noxsubst.pdf), EPA states the \"condition for\ndemonstrating equivalency is that the State-proposed emission control strategies must be\nconsistent with emission reductions required to demonstrate attainment of the ozone NAAQS\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 15\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nfor the designated year of attainment.\"\nTo ensure equitable treatment among all major stationary sources, maintain consistency within\nthe fee program, and facilitate transparency for the public, the proposed rules require that\nbaseline amounts and aggregation methods, once established, would remain fixed as long as\nthe proposed rule remains applicable except as consistent with the proposed sections that\nallow adjustments under specific circumstances. Additionally, the proposed rules would require\nthat calculation of the Failure to Attain Fee remain consistent with the baseline amount\ndetermination approach. Once a particular method for a baseline amount calculation is chosen,\nthe Failure to Attain Fee calculation must remain consistent with that method. Therefore, if a\nmajor stationary source elected to aggregate pollutants under one of the options of this\nproposed rulemaking as the most appropriate choice for determining a baseline amount, all\nsubsequent assessments, and payments of the Failure to Attain Fee must remain consistent\nwith that selection.\nThe commission also proposes compliance schedules for determining baseline amounts for\neach applicable baseline amount scenario. Since the proposed Failure to Attain Fee cannot be\nimplemented until EPA finalizes a failure to attain notice that determines that a severe or\nextreme nonattainment area under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard did not attain by the\napplicable due date, the due dates for major stationary sources operating during the baseline\nyear are structured to account for issuance of this notice. New major stationary sources that\nbegin operating during or after the baseline year would have a fixed amount of time to self-\nreport the baseline amounts to TCEQ. The compliance schedules would ensure timely\nassessment of the fee.\nThe commission proposes to invoice and require fee payment in accordance with current state\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 16\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nstatute and regulations. Once the program is implemented, fee payments would be due each\nyear until the Section 185 fee is terminated.\nIf this proposed rule is adopted, any Section 185 fee revenue collected by TCEQ would be\ndeposited into the Clear Air Account according to THSC §382.0622. Since spending potential\nSection 185 fee revenue depends on this proposed rule’s adoption, Texas’ collection of the\nSection 185 fee, and future Legislative actions, this proposed rulemaking does not include\noptions for how any potential collected Section 185 revenue would be spent.\nThe proposed rules would ensure stability of the Clean Air Account and any potential future\nprograms that could be developed using the Failure to Attain Fee revenue by preventing\nadjustments to previously invoiced baseline amounts for instances in which baselines are\nadjusted as proposed in §101.708, §101.709, §101.710, and §101.711. No matter the scenario\nused to adjust the baseline amount it would apply starting with the next fee assessment year.\nSection by Section Discussion\n§101.700, Definitions\nThis proposed new section contains definitions necessary for applying the rules. The terms\ndefined include actual emissions, Area §185 Obligation, attainment date, baseline amount,\nbaseline emissions, baseline year, electric utility steam generating unit, emissions unit,\nequivalency credits, extension year, Failure to Attain Fee, fee assessment year, fee collection\nyear, major stationary source, and Section 185 Account.\nAs proposed, the term actual emissions would use the definition currently used in 30 TAC\n§101.10; this would ensure that the VOC and/or NO emissions assessed for the Failure to\nX\nAttain Fee include all emissions emitted from the major stationary source for the calendar year\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 17\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nbeing assessed, whether authorized or unauthorized emissions.\nThe Area §185 Obligation is proposed to be defined as the total amount of the Failure to Attain\nFee due for an entire 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area based on summing the Failure\nto Attain Fee due from each major stationary source for a fee assessment year. For the 2008\neight-hour ozone standard, the 10-county DFW and eight-county HGB nonattainment areas\nwould have separate Area §185 Obligations. EPA’s 2010 guidance states that an equivalent\nprogram could be acceptable under FCAA, §172(e) if an alternative fee or program is equivalent\nto the fee that would be assessed on an area failing to meet the ozone standard. The Area §185\nObligation is the basis for making an equivalency demonstration for the commission’s\nproposed program. The equivalency credits are proposed to be defined as revenue collected in a\ncalendar year from TERP to offset the Area §185 Obligation on a dollar-to-dollar basis. If there\nare insufficient funds to offset the entire Area §185 Obligation, then Failure to Attain Fee would\nbe prorated and the prorated fee amount assessed directly on major stationary sources or\nSection 185 Accounts to meet the entire Area §185 Obligation.\nAttainment date is proposed to be defined as the EPA-specified date an area is required to\nattain the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard under the FCAA.\nThe attainment year is the entire calendar year that contains the attainment date. For purposes\nof this proposed rulemaking, the baseline year is proposed to be defined as January 1 through\nDecember 31 of the attainment year. At the time of the proposed rulemaking, there were two\nareas classified as severe nonattainment under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, the 10-\ncounty DFW nonattainment area (Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker,\nRockwall, Tarrant, and Wise Counties) and the eight-county HGB nonattainment area (Brazoria,\nChambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties). The severe\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 18\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nclassification attainment date for these areas is July 20, 2027; therefore, the 2027 calendar year\nfrom January 1, 2027, through December 31, 2027, would determine both the attainment year\nand baseline year of 2027, unless EPA approved an attainment date extension under FCAA,\n§181(a)(5).\nConsistent with FCAA, §185, baseline amount is proposed to be the lower of baseline emissions\n(actual emissions as described in §101.705) or total annual authorized or pending authorization\nemissions at a major stationary source as of December 31 of the baseline year if the major\nstationary source operated the entire baseline year. For major stationary sources that began\noperating during or after the baseline year, the first full year (12 consecutive months) operating\nas a major source would be used to determine the baseline emissions. If the major stationary\nsource’s emissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to year, the\nbaseline emissions are proposed to be averaged from any single consecutive 24-month period\nwithin a historical period, as outlined in the proposed definition of baseline emissions.\nFor purposes of this proposed rulemaking, the term baseline emissions represents the “actual\nemissions” referenced in FCAA, §185(b)(2) and excludes unauthorized emissions. The baseline\nemissions are reported in the annual point source emissions inventory according to the\nEmissions Inventory Requirements of 30 TAC §101.10. The baseline emissions are proposed to\ninclude reported annual emissions that are authorized by permit or rule from routine\noperations, which includes authorized MSS activities during the baseline year or another time\nperiod as allowed by this proposed rule, but excludes unauthorized emissions. Emissions from\nemissions events and MSS activities not authorized by permit or rule must be excluded from\nthe baseline emissions calculations because they are not authorized or representative of routine\noperations. The exclusion of unauthorized emissions from the baseline emissions calculation is\nconsistent with the PSD definition of baseline actual emissions in §116.112 and 40 CFR\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 19\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n§52.21(b)(48) that does not include unauthorized emissions in a baseline amount\ndetermination.\nThis proposed definition of baseline emissions differs from the definition of actual emissions in\n30 TAC §101.10, which includes all emissions emitted, whether authorized or unauthorized,\nreported in the emissions inventory. The proposed definition of baseline emissions represents\nonly the emissions from authorized routine operations reported in the emissions inventory.\nIf the major stationary source’s emissions reported in the emissions inventory are irregular,\ncyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to year, the baseline emissions are proposed to\nbe averaged from any single consecutive 24-month period within a historical period. The\nhistorical period allowed depends on the type of emissions units, following PSD guidance.\nElectrical utility steam generating units are included in this proposed rule because they may use\na five-year historic look-back period. The definition of electric utility steam generating units is\nconsistent with the definition used in 30 TAC §116.12. Other emissions units, as defined in\n§101.1, may use a ten-year historic look-back period.\nExtension year is proposed to be defined as a year that meets the requirements of FCAA,\n§181(a)(5). It is unknown whether the 10-county DFW or the eight-county HGB severe\nnonattainment areas under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard may qualify for an extension,\nand an extension year may be applicable to future areas designated as severe or extreme\nnonattainment under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard.\nThe Failure to Attain Fee is proposed to be defined as the fee assessed and due from each\nmajor stationary source or Section 185 Account based on actual emissions, whether authorized\nor unauthorized, of VOC, NO , or both exceeding 80% of the baseline amount.\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 20\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nThe fee assessment year is proposed to be defined as the calendar year the actual emissions\nwere emitted and reported to the emissions inventory and used to calculate the assessed fee\namount. The actual emissions include all authorized and unauthorized emissions, such as\nroutine, MSS, and emissions events (EE) reported in the emissions inventory, as discussed in\n§101.713. For the 10-county DFW and eight-county HGB severe classification nonattainment\nareas under 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, the fee could be assessed as early as calendar\nyear 2028 should the areas not attain by July 20, 2027. The fee collection year is proposed to be\ndefined as the calendar year the fee is invoiced by TCEQ.\nThe definition for major stationary source is consistent with the definition in §116.12 for\ndetermining a major source of VOC or NO emissions. Because major stationary sources under\nX\ncommon control may opt to aggregate pollutants and/or sites for purposes of baseline amount\ndetermination and Failure to Attain Fee payment, a Section 185 Account represents either a\nmajor stationary source (if not choosing to aggregate) or a group of two or more major\nstationary sources (if aggregating). A single identifying Section 185 Account number would be\nassigned by TCEQ to track the option chosen for baseline amounts and Failure to Attain Fee\nassessments in the TCEQ Section 185 database. Because major stationary sources can be\naggregated on a pollutant basis, a major stationary source may be in one Section 185 Account\nfor VOC aggregation and in a second Section 185 Account for NO aggregation. A single major\nX\nstationary source could belong to two separate Section 185 Accounts, or a Section 185 Account\nmay only have one major stationary source. All major stationary sources of VOC and/or NO\nX\nemissions located in a severe or extreme 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area that did\nnot attain by the attainment date are subject to this proposed rule. Even if a major stationary\nsource did not comply and, as a result, did not receive a Section 185 Account from TCEQ, that\nsource would still be subject to this proposed rule and would still owe a Section 185 fee.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 21\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n§101.701, Applicability\nThis new section proposes the applicability requirements for the FCAA, §185 fee (Failure to\nAttain Fee). FCAA, §185 requires areas classified as severe or extreme for ozone to include a\nrequirement for fees on VOC emissions in excess of 80% of a baseline amount for major\nstationary sources located in an area failing to attain the standard by the attainment date\napplicable to that area. FCAA, §182(f) further requires that all SIP requirements applying to\nVOC emissions sources also apply for NO emissions sources. Proposed §101.701 identifies the\nX\nprovisions that apply to any 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area classified as severe or\nextreme that fails to demonstrate attainment of the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard by its\nattainment date.\nThe proposed rule is applicable to all major stationary sources in the 2008 eight-hour ozone\nnonattainment area each year that the penalty fee is applicable as required by FCAA, §185.\nAt the time of the proposed rulemaking, there were two areas classified as severe\nnonattainment under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, the 10-county DFW (Collin, Dallas,\nDenton, Ellis, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant, and Wise Counties) and the eight-\ncounty HGB (Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller\nCounties). In the future, should EPA designate other areas of Texas as severe or extreme\nnonattainment under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, then this proposed rulemaking\nwould be applicable to those severe or extreme nonattainment areas.\nThe executive director would implement this proposed rule upon EPA determining that the area\nfailed to attain the severe or extreme 2008 eight-hour ozone standard. This determination\nwould be the effective date of EPA’s finding of failure to attain notice for severe or extreme\nareas under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard published in the Federal Register. There are no\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 22\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nobligations for major stationary sources until the rule is implemented. As part of its outreach\nefforts, TCEQ would electronically distribute courtesy notifications to regulated entities that\nthe Section 185 fee has been implemented. Electronic notification, as allowed under 30 TAC\n§19.30, would include posting on the Stakeholder Group: Federal Clean Air Act Section 185 Fee\nwebpage (available at https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/point-source-ei/185-fee), subscribers\nof the Penalty Fee for Major Stationary Sources Under the Federal Clean Air Act Section 185\nemail and text list (available at\n(https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/TXTCEQ/subscriber/new), and/or other allowed\nelectronic means of communication.\nThe Failure to Attain Fee would start being assessed for the calendar year following the missed\nattainment date. The proposed rule defines the attainment year as the entire calendar year that\ncontains the attainment date. For purposes of this proposed rulemaking, the term baseline year\nis defined as January 1 through December 31 of the attainment year. For the 10-county DFW\nand eight-county HGB severe nonattainment areas under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard,\nwhich have a July 20, 2027, attainment date, the attainment year and baseline year are\nanticipated to be 2027. The fee would start being assessed for calendar year 2028 (first fee\nassessment year), unless EPA approved an attainment date extension under FCAA, §181(a)(5).\n§101.702, Exemption\nThis new section proposes that no Failure to Attain fee payment is due for a year determined\nby EPA to be an extension year under FCAA, §181(a)(5) for the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard.\nEPA may grant an extension year for a nonattainment area if all SIP obligations have been met\nand if one or fewer measured ozone exceedances occurred at any valid monitoring site in the\nnonattainment area in a year. It is unknown whether the 10-county DFW area or the eight-\ncounty HGB severe nonattainment area under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard may qualify\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 23\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nfor an extension. Additionally, an extension year may be applicable if EPA designates future\nareas as severe or extreme nonattainment under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard and\ngrants those areas an extension year. For any area granted an extension, the fee would be\napplicable if the severe or extreme nonattainment area did not attain by the extension\nattainment date specified by EPA.\n§101.703, Fee Equivalency Account\nThis new section proposes that the executive director establish a Fee Equivalency Account. This\naccount would be a listing of revenues from designated programs that reduce VOC or NO\nX\nemissions in 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas. Only the revenue collected within\neach 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area would be credited and available to offset the\nArea §185 Obligation in the Fee Equivalency Account. Revenue collected in the 10-county DFW\n2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area would be credited only within that nonattainment\narea. Revenue collected in the eight-county HGB 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area\nwould be credited only within that nonattainment area. Specifically, TCEQ proposes that\nrevenue collected for the TERP program would be used to offset each 2008 eight-hour ozone\nnonattainment area’s Area §185 Obligation for the area when funds are also expended within\neach area. This would result in a benefit directly to the nonattainment area from revenue\ncollected. TERP’s stated goals and statutory restrictions provide funding for programs or\nactivities that result in reductions in VOC, NO , and other pollutant emissions into the\nX\natmosphere.\nNo transfer of revenue would occur between TERP and the Fee Equivalency Account. The Fee\nEquivalency Account is a documentation mechanism to verify the amount of TERP revenue\ncollected in the 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area to offset the fee on major stationary\nsources located in that area. If other emissions reduction grant programs become available\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 24\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nthose would be considered for inclusion to offset the Failure to Attain Fee.\n§101.704, Fee Equivalency Accounting\nThis new section proposes that the Area §185 Obligation would be the total FCAA, §185 fee\ndetermined annually for each 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area. The FCAA, §185 fee\n(Failure to Attain Fee) is proposed to be calculated for each major stationary source or Section\n185 Account by TCEQ staff using the approved baseline amounts and emissions inventory data\nfor the fee assessment year. These resultant individual Failure to Attain Fees would be summed\nto determine the overall Area §185 Obligation within the same 2008 eight-hour ozone\nnonattainment area.\nRevenue, calculated on a dollar basis, associated with the Fee Equivalency Account would be\ncredited starting with the first fee assessment year and continuing annually. The funding\nassociated with the Fee Equivalency Account for a given fee assessment year would be\ncompared with the Area §185 Obligation for a given fee assessment year.\nIf the Fee Equivalency Account does not have enough funds to fully meet the Area §185\nObligation, a backstop provision would be invoked under which major stationary sources or\nSection 185 Accounts would be assessed a prorated Failure to Attain Fee to generate sufficient\nfunds to meet the Area §185 Obligation. The prorated Failure to Attain Fee would be calculated\nbased on the amount in the Fee Equivalency Account and the overall Area §185 Obligation. The\nFailure to Attain Fee amount that the major stationary source or Section 185 Account would be\nrequired to pay is proposed to be reduced to the prorated Failure to Attain Fee amount based\non the calculations in this proposed rulemaking. This process would be documented and made\npublicly available each year.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 25\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nFor example, a hypothetical Area §185 Obligation for HGB for the 2028 fee assessment year is\ncalculated by TCEQ staff as $154 million. The HGB area Fee Equivalency Account for calendar\nyear 2028 has $45 million available from TERP revenue. The HGB area balance for the 2028 fee\nassessment year is $109 million ($154 million less $45 million) and that amount must be paid\nby major stationary sources located in HGB that are subject to the Failure to Attain Fee. For the\n2028 fee assessment year, the Fee Equivalency Account covers 29.22% ($45 million divided by\n$154 million, with the quotient multiplied by 100) of the Area §185 Obligation for HGB and\neach major stationary source’s or Section 185 Account’s fee will be reduced by 29.22%. TCEQ\nstaff calculates that the Failure to Attain Fee for a hypothetical Section 185 Account located in\nHGB is $50,000 for the 2028 fee assessment year. The prorated Failure to Attain Fee for the\nhypothetical Section 185 Account would be calculated by reducing the $50,000 fee by 29.22%,\nresulting in the hypothetical Section 185 Account owing $35,389.61.\nThe timing of the demonstration would likely occur in December and then annually afterward,\nexcept for the first year the program is implemented. The date that TCEQ performs this\nevaluation for the first year of program implementation depends on the dates of future federal\nor state actions that are not currently scheduled (e.g., effective date in the Federal Register of\nEPA’s finding of failure to attain).\n§101.705, Baseline Amount\nThis new section proposes the requirements for determining a baseline amount. FCAA, §185\nrequires a fee on emissions exceeding 80% of a fee baseline amount determined for the\nattainment year (referenced as baseline year in this proposed rulemaking) until the Section 185\nfee (referred to as Failure to Attain Fee in this proposed rulemaking) no longer applies to the\narea. Unless the major stationary source or Section 185 Account qualifies for an adjustment to\nthe baseline amount, as outlined in the various adjustment sections of this proposed\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 26\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nrulemaking, the method for a fixed, one-time calculation of the baseline amount is provided in\nthis proposed section.\nA baseline amount would be required for each ozone precursor pollutant, VOC and/or NO , for\nX\nwhich the source is major. If a stationary source is major for both VOC and NO emissions, a\nX\nbaseline amount would be required for both VOC and NO emissions. If the major stationary\nX\nsource is major for only VOC or NO emissions, the baseline amount would be required for just\nX\nthat pollutant, VOC or NO .\nX\nThe baseline amount is proposed to be defined as the lower of either: the baseline emissions\ndefined as the total annual routine emissions, including reported MSS emissions that are\nauthorized by permit or rule, reported in the emissions inventory, as described in 30 TAC\n§101.10 for the baseline year, or timeframe otherwise specified in this proposed rule; or the\ntotal annual emissions allowed by the applicable authorizations or pending authorizations in\neffect for the major stationary source during the baseline year or timeframe otherwise specified\nin this proposed rule. MSS emissions reported in the emissions inventory that are authorized by\npermit or rule are considered routine and must be included in baseline emissions. The major\nstationary source’s authorized or pending authorization emissions include emissions allowed\nunder any TCEQ-enforceable measure or document, such as rules, regulations, permits, orders\nof the commission, and/or court orders.\nEmissions from pending authorizations with administratively complete applications as of\nDecember 31 of the baseline year or timeframe otherwise specified may be included in the total\nannual emissions allowed under authorizations. Some owners or operators of major stationary\nsources may submit administratively complete applications for authorizing previously\nunauthorized emissions prior to December 31 of the baseline year or other approved\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 27\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\ntimeframe. To not penalize sources in the process of obtaining an authorization, the\ncommission proposes to allow the emission limits established by permits that were\nadministratively complete to adjust the baseline amount by adding these amounts to the total\nannual authorized emissions. The proposed approach aligns with the FCAA intent of comparing\nauthorized emissions with reported actual emissions to determine a baseline amount.\nA timeframe chosen other than the baseline year to determine a baseline amount depends on\nwhether the major stationary source began operating during or after the baseline year or if the\nmajor stationary source’s emissions qualify to be averaged over a 24-month consecutive period.\nApplicable timeframes for baseline amounts are outlined in this proposed rulemaking.\nUnauthorized emissions, such as from EE and MSS activities not authorized by permit or rule,\nare not included in the baseline amount. Exclusion of unauthorized emissions from a baseline\namount is consistent with these emissions not being representative of normal, routine\noperations and with the PSD definition of baseline actual emissions in §116.112 and 40 CFR\n§52.21(b)(48). For example, an oil and gas major stationary source for both VOC and NO\nX\nemissions experienced VOC emissions from tank flashing that exceeded an authorized permit\nlimit. Tank flashing is a routine operation so the unauthorized VOC emissions resulting from\nthe tank flashing that exceeded the permit limit are required to be reported in the emissions\ninventory as annual routine emissions. The unauthorized but routine VOC emissions from the\ntank flashing would be excluded from the baseline emissions calculations used to determine\nbaseline amount.\nIf the major stationary source has reported emissions in the emissions inventory that are\nirregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to year, an alternate method to\ndetermine baseline emissions would be allowed. Whether a source qualifies as irregular,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 28\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\ncyclical, or otherwise varying significantly is determined on a case-by-case basis. For these\nmajor stationary sources, any single consecutive 24-month period within a specified historical\nperiod could be averaged for the baseline emissions. Major stationary sources that qualify to\nestablish an equivalent alternate fee baseline amount in this manner would calculate the\nbaseline emissions using historical annual routine emissions, as recorded in the emissions\ninventory, which includes authorized emissions from MSS activities.\nThe FCAA, §185 does not address how to define a historical period; however, EPA issued a\nMarch 21, 2008, guidance memo, referenced elsewhere in this preamble, stating that an\nacceptable alternate method would be to determine an baseline amount using a period similar\nto estimating \"baseline actual emissions\" found in EPA’s PSD rules, 40 CFR §52.21(b)(48). In its\nMarch 21, 2008, guidance, EPA used these provisions to craft its guidance on a ten-year look-\nback period for calculating baseline actual emissions. The PSD rules require adequate data for\nthe selected 24-month period. The data must adequately describe the operation and emission\nlevels for each emissions unit. The guidance continues by stating: \"Once calculated, the average\nannual emission rate must be adjusted downward to reflect 1) any noncompliant emissions (40\nCFR §52.21(b)(48)(i)(b) and (ii)(b)); and 2) for each non-utility emissions unit, the most current\nlegally enforceable emissions limitations that restrict the source’s ability to emit a particular\npollutant or to operate at levels that existed during the 24-month period that was selected (40\nCFR §52.21(b)(48)(ii)(c)).\" The result of this restriction is that the plant capacity may be used\nduring the historical 24-month period selected, but emissions that do not comply with legally\nenforceable limits would have to be excluded. Legally enforceable emissions limits would\ninclude any state or federal requirements, including Best Achievable Control Technology or\nLowest Achievable Emissions Rate.\nAccording to PSD guidance, the timeframe for the historical look-back period for emissions\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 29\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nunits other than electric steam generating units is any single consecutive 24-month period\nwithin the ten-year period immediately preceding the date a complete permit application was\nsubmitted. For electric steam generating units the timeframe for the historical look-back period\nis any single consecutive 24-month period within the five-year period immediately preceding\nthe date a complete permit application was submitted. The historical look-back period for the\nproposed equivalent alternate fee baseline amount determination would start the calendar year\nimmediately preceding the baseline year. All emissions units at a major stationary source or\nSection 185 Account would be required to use the same 24-month period when calculating\nbaseline amounts for aggregated pollutants or sites under common control or ownership. The\ncommission interprets the FCAA, §185 language requiring the use of the lower of baseline\nemissions (actual emissions from the emissions inventory as defined in §101.701) or emissions\nallowed under authorizations (e.g. permitted emissions) to include emissions from this\nalternate method.\nAt the time of this proposed rulemaking, the baseline year is anticipated to be 2027 for the 10-\ncounty DFW and eight-county HGB 2008 eight-hour ozone standard severe nonattainment areas.\nThe window used for the possible historical look-back period would be five years (2022 - 2026)\nfor electric generating units (EGU) or 10 years (2007 - 2026) for non-EGU immediately preceding\nJanuary 1, 2027. The average emissions during the single consecutive 24-month period would\nbe the basis for determining the baseline emissions, in tons.\nIf rules or regulations take effect during the baseline year and/or 24-month consecutive period\nused for baseline amount determination, then the baseline emissions and total annual\nauthorized emissions must be adjusted downward to reflect emissions that would have\nexceeded a legally enforceable emissions limitation requirement from a permit, rule, regulation,\ncommission order, or court order during the applicable timeframe. The major stationary source\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 30\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nwould not be allowed to take credit for emissions reductions that would have resulted from\nstate or federal rules or regulations implemented during the baseline year and/or 24-month\nconsecutive period used to calculate the baseline amount.\nFor example, a major stationary source of VOC emissions started operating prior to the 2027\nbaseline year, and the baseline amount was established from the baseline emissions during the\n2027 baseline year. On March 1, 2027, a hypothetical federal rule takes effect that limits\nemissions from coatings emissions units located at the major source. The baseline emissions\nfor the coatings emissions units impacted by the 2027 federal rule’s emissions limits would be\nadjusted downward from January 1, 2027, through February 28, 2027, to account for the new\nlimit. In another example, a major source of VOC emissions establishes a baseline amount using\nthe 24-month consecutive period from July 12, 2022, through July 12, 2024. During calendar\nyear 2027, a hypothetical federal rule takes effect that limits emissions from coatings\nemissions units located at the major source during the 24-month consecutive period chosen for\nthe baseline amount. The baseline emissions for coatings emissions units impacted by the 2027\nfederal rules’ emissions limits would be adjusted downward during the July 12, 2022, through\nJuly 12, 2024, period chosen for the baseline amount.\nFugitive emissions would be required to be included for the purposes of the baseline emissions\ncalculations and fee assessments. This is similar to the Title V Emissions Fees described in 30\nTAC §101.27, which requires all fugitive emissions to be included in fee calculations after\napplicability of the fee has been established. Per 40 CFR §70.2, fugitive emissions of VOC or\nNO belonging to one of the categories listed in paragraph 2 of the definition of major sources\nX\nmay be excluded from counting toward major source applicability. Once the source meets the\nmajor stationary source applicability requirements of 30 TAC §116.12, fugitive emissions are\nrequired to be reported in the emissions inventory, and the fugitive emissions must be used for\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 31\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nboth baseline emissions calculations and fee assessments.\nAs allowed under the Emissions Inventory Requirements described in 30 TAC §101.10, a\nregulated entity that meets the applicability requirements to submit an emissions inventory,\nwhich includes major stationary sources, may submit a certifying letter instead of reporting\nupdated emissions in the emissions inventory. The certifying letter option is allowed for any\nregulated entity (identified by the nine-digit regulated entity reference number (RN) and a\nseven-character alphanumeric TCEQ account number) that experienced an insignificant change\nin operating conditions compared to the most recently submitted emissions inventory. An\ninsignificant change in emissions is defined as including start-ups, permanent shut-downs of\nindividual units, or process changes that result in at least a 5.0% or 5 tpy, whichever is greater,\nincrease or reduction in total annual emissions of VOC, NO , carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide,\nX\nlead, particulate matter (PM) less than or equal to 10 microns in diameter, or PM less than or\nequal to 2.5 microns in diameter. If a regulated entity submits a certifying insignificant change\nnotification letter instead of updating the emissions, then the emissions reported in the most\nrecently submitted emissions inventory are copied over to the current emissions inventory\nreporting year. For example, if a regulated entity submits an insignificant change notification\nletter for the 2027 emissions inventory reporting year and TCEQ staff verified that the\nrequirements of the insignificant change notification letter were met, then the 2026 emissions\nare copied over to also represent the 2027 emissions. Major sources are cautioned to consider\nthe impacts of choosing to submit an insignificant change letter instead of updating emissions\nin the emissions inventory because of the implications for baseline amount determinations and\nfee assessments.\nEmissions inventory data are collected annually by the commission and, after quality assurance\nreview, are loaded into the state’s air emissions inventory database, the State of Texas Air\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 32\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nReporting System (STARS). Since Texas’ emissions inventory program submits data to EPA’s\nNational Emissions Inventory (NEI), the quality assurance of emissions inventory data is subject\nto a federally mandated Quality Management Plan (QMP) that annually documents and\ndescribes the emissions inventory organization arrangements, processes, procedures, and\nrequirements. As part of the QMP, the emissions inventory program annually submits a Quality\nAssurance Project Plan (QAPP) documenting the emissions inventory quality assurance process\nfor EPA’s review and approval. The QAPP includes information on how TCEQ staff perform\nannual detailed technical reviews of point source emissions inventories, correct issues, and\ndocument the outcome of the review. Actual emissions reported in the emissions inventory that\nare subject to the detailed quality assurance process include: all emissions resulting from\nroutine operations, including emissions from authorized MSS activities; all unscheduled MSS\nactivities (reportable and non-reportable); and all emissions events (reportable and non-\nreportable). Owners or operators of major stationary sources are provided an opportunity to\nreview and, if necessary, revise emissions submitted for the current reporting year and for the\nreporting year immediately prior. Revisions to historical inventory data outside of this\ntimeframe are done on a case-by-case basis usually as a result of a TCEQ-directed emissions\ninventory improvement initiative or TCEQ’s compliance and enforcement processes. The\ncommission uses emissions inventory data for air quality planning, as detailed in SIP revisions.\nAlthough emissions determination methods improve over time, emissions inventory data\nrepresent emissions for a reporting year as accurately as possible. Since the commission relies\nupon emissions inventory data in SIP revisions for air quality planning purposes, revising\nhistorical emissions inventory emissions rates solely for purposes of adjusting the baseline\namounts and related calculations is not supported. Similar to emissions inventories, air permits\nare reviewed to ensure accuracy of emissions.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 33\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nA baseline amount would account for all emissions units located at the major stationary source\nas of December 31 of the baseline year. Any ownership transfer of emissions units that\noccurred by December 31 of the baseline year would also need to be included in the baseline\namount calculation. If a 24-month consecutive period is chosen for a major source that\noperated the entire baseline year, then all emissions units located at the major stationary\nsource as of December 31 of the baseline year must be included, regardless of whether they\nwere located at the major stationary source during the period chosen. An owner or operator of\na major stationary source or Section 185 Account may not exclude new emissions units added\nby the baseline year from the 24-month consecutive historical period. For example, a qualified\nmajor stationary source chooses March 19, 2022, through March 19, 2024, as the 24-month\nconsecutive period for the baseline emissions. An emissions unit was purchased, and\nownership transferred to the source on September 1, 2026; therefore, those emissions must be\naveraged and added to the 24-month period chosen. The major stationary source that sold the\nemissions units may not include the sold emissions units in their baseline amount to avoid\ndouble-counting of the same emissions units in different baseline amounts.\nThe proposed rule would require that the baseline amount calculation and supporting\ndocumentation be submitted to TCEQ in a format specified by the executive director.\nDocumentation would include either a list of all emission units by their corresponding path-\nlevel emissions reported in the point source emissions inventory or all applicable air permits by\nEmissions Point Identification Number (EPN) (depending on which one is required for the\nbaseline amount determination). If a major source uses path-level emissions to determine\nbaseline amounts, VOC and/or NO emissions must be reported by a combination of Facility\nX\nIdentification Number (FIN) and corresponding EPN that match the most recent point source\nemissions inventory. If a major stationary source uses permitted allowable emissions to\ndetermine baseline amounts, VOC and/or NO emissions must be reported at the EPN level.\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 34\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nSample calculations would be required for each path-level (emissions inventory) or EPN level\n(air permits) used for baseline amount determination.\nA major stationary source may choose to establish a baseline amount from baseline emissions\nfor sources with emissions that are irregular, cyclic, or otherwise vary significantly from year to\nyear. Sufficient supporting documentation would be required to verify that the major stationary\nsource’s emissions qualify as irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to\nyear. Additionally, details on why and how the 24-month consecutive period chosen accurately\nrepresents the major source’s emissions would be required.\nThere is no list of sites that meet the definition of a major stationary source as defined in 30\nTAC §116.12. TCEQ would use established programs to assist with notifying major sources of\nNO and/or VOC emissions subject to the fee to provide baseline amounts by the due dates in\nX\nthis proposed rulemaking. Although TCEQ would attempt to notify all applicable major\nstationary sources by using the Title V permitting and air emissions inventory programs as\nsurrogate data for major sources, compliance with this proposed rulemaking is required even if\nTCEQ does not specifically notify the major stationary source. Compliance with the Section 185\nfee program is a requirement of FCAA, §185, and a major stationary source that does not\nprovide a baseline amount by the specified due date would be subject to the executive director\nestablishing the baseline amounts as described in this proposed rulemaking so that TCEQ can\nassess the required fee.\nFor major stationary sources operating prior to January 1 of the baseline year or that operated\nthe entire baseline year, the regulated entity will complete the baseline amount form and\nsupporting documentation. A specific due date for initial baseline amount cannot be provided\nsince the implementation of the Failure to Atain Fee depends on the timing of three future\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 35\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nactions: TCEQ adoption of this proposed rule; the severe nonattainment areas failing to attain\nby July 20, 2027, based on 2024, 2025, and 2026 ambient air monitoring data (or by the date\nestablished by any extension year granted by EPA); and the effective date in the Federal Register\nof EPA’s finding of failure to attain. As proposed, regulated entities would submit baseline\nforms either on the emissions inventory due date specified under the Emissions Inventory\nRequirements in 30 TAC §101.10 for the fee assessment year or 120 days from the effective\ndate of EPA’s failure to attain notice. Providing no less than 120 days for regulated entities to\nprepare baseline amounts allows flexibility for the executive director to initially implement the\nfinal Failure to Attain Fee rule and initiate related business processes. For the 10-county DFW\nand eight-county HGB severe 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment areas at the time of this\nproposed rulemaking, the baseline amount based on a 2027 baseline year may be due March 31,\n2028 (depending on final Air Emissions Inventory Reporting Rule updates currently in progress\nby EPA as of the date of this proposed rulemaking), or 120 days from the effective date of EPA’s\nfailure to attain notice.\nElectronic notification, as allowed under 30 TAC §19.30, would include posting on the\nStakeholder Group: Federal Clean Air Act Section 185 Fee webpage (available at\nhttps://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/point-source-ei/185-fee), subscribers to the listserv for\nPenalty Fee for Major Stationary Sources Under the Federal Clean Air Act Section 185 would\nreceive email and/or text notifications (sign-up available at\n(https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/TXTCEQ/subscriber/new), and/or other allowed\nelectronic means of communication.\nOnce finalized, the baseline amount would be fixed and would not be changed except as\nconsistent with the proposed adjustments in §§101.708-711.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 36\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n§101.706, Baseline Amount for New Major Stationary Sources\nStates are required to assess the Section 185 fee on all major sources of VOC and/or NO\nX\nemissions located in a severe or extreme ozone nonattainment area that fails to attain by its\nattainment date. This would include major stationary sources that began operating as a major\nsource or transitioned to a major source status during the baseline year or after the baseline\nyear. Since FCAA, §185 does not provide baseline amount determinations for these scenarios,\nthe commission proposes this new section to determine a baseline amount for these new major\nstationary sources.\nThe commission proposes that these new major stationary sources use their first year (12\nconsecutive months) operating as a major stationary source to determine the baseline amount\nor aggregated baseline amount. The baseline amount must be the lower of the baseline\nemissions during the first year of operation as a major source or the total annual authorized\nemissions during the first year of operation as a major source.\nEPA, in its December 14, 2012, notice of final approval of the South Coast Air Quality\nManagement District (SCAQMD) SIP revision (77 FR 74372), allowed a major stationary source\nsubject to FCAA, §185 rules after the attainment date in the SCAQMD to use actual emissions\nor authorizations (or holdings in its banking program) from its initial calendar year of\noperation to set a baseline amount. EPA, in its February 14, 2020, notice of final approval of the\nHGB Failure to Attain Fee (85 FR 8411), allowed major stationary sources to determine the\nbaseline amounts on the lower of actual or allowable data available in their first year of\noperation as a major stationary source.\nIf rules or regulations take effect during the first full year operating as a major source, then the\nbaseline emissions and total annual authorized emissions must be adjusted downward to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 37\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nreflect those emissions limitations in effect during that timeframe. For example, a major\nstationary source of VOC emissions started operating January 10, 2027, and the baseline\namount was established from the baseline emissions during the first full year of operation,\nfrom January 10, 2027, to January 10, 2028. On March 1, 2027, a hypothetical federal rule takes\neffect that limit emissions from coatings emissions units located at the major source. The\nbaseline emissions for the coatings emissions units impacted by the 2027 federal rule’s\nemissions limits would be adjusted downward for the entire baseline period (January 10, 2027,\nthrough January 10, 2028) to account for the new limit. The major source would not be allowed\nto take credit for emissions reductions that would have resulted from state or federal rules or\nregulations implemented or in effect during the calendar year used to calculate baseline\nemissions.\nA baseline amount at a new major stationary source would account for all emissions units\nlocated at the major stationary source as of the last calendar day of the first full year operating\nas a major source. For example, a major stationary source of VOC emissions begins operating\non February 4, 2028, and the baseline amounts are determined using the February 4, 2028,\nthrough February 4, 2029, timeframe. In this example, the major stationary source would\ninclude all emissions units, including any ownership transferred emissions units as of February\n4, 2029, in the baseline amount.\nFor major stationary sources that begin operating between January 1 and December 31 of the\nbaseline year or after December 31 of the baseline year, regulated entities would have 90 days\nfrom the last calendar day of the first full year operating as a major source to submit the\nbaseline amount form. Since initial Section 185 fee program implementation has already\noccurred, a 90-day timeframe is an appropriate length of time for form submission and is\nconsistent with emissions inventory reporting timeframes. For example, a major source of VOC\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 38\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nemissions begins operating on February 4, 2028, and the baseline amounts are determined\nusing February 4, 2028, through February 4, 2029. In this example, the regulated entity would\nhave 90 days from February 4, 2029, to submit the baseline amounts and supporting\ndocumentation.\n§101.707, Aggregated Baseline Amount\nThis proposed new section would provide for the aggregation of either VOC or NO emissions\nX\n(or both) at multiple major stationary sources to align fee obligations with attainment\ndemonstration emissions reduction approaches. The proposed rule would allow owners or\noperators of major stationary sources under common control to aggregate baseline amounts of\nVOC emissions from multiple major stationary sources, to aggregate NO emissions from\nX\nmultiple major stationary sources, or both. Owners or operators may also choose to aggregate\nVOC with NO emissions at a single major stationary source or VOC with NO emissions across\nX X\nmultiple major stationary sources under common control, provided that the stationary sources\nare major for both pollutants. Once an owner or operator chooses aggregation, then the\nbaseline amount would remain aggregated, and the fees would be assessed in the same manner\nas the aggregation until the Failure to Attain Fee no longer applies to the area.\nBaseline amounts would first be calculated separately for each individual major stationary\nsource for VOC or NO emissions, or for both, using the method described in proposed new\nX\n§101.705 or §101.706. The separate initial baseline amounts for each pollutant at an individual\nmajor stationary source must also be submitted in a format specified by the executive director\nwith supporting documentation. Providing the separate initial calculations of baseline amounts\nis intended to provide transparency and consistency and to assist with quality assurance of\nbaseline amount determinations with any subsequent aggregation. After establishing separate\nbaseline amounts, then the baseline amount could be aggregated by multiple pollutants,\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 39\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nmultiple stationary sources under common control, or both.\nThe proposed rule would allow owners or operators of major stationary sources to aggregate\nVOC and NO baseline amounts at a major stationary source. Sources under common ownership\nX\nand/or control could also opt to aggregate baseline amounts across multiple major stationary\nsources. Only major stationary sources under common control may be included in the\naggregate group. The aggregation methodology must remain consistent throughout the baseline\namount calculation and assessment of the Failure to Attain Fee. A group of major stationary\nsources opting to aggregate baseline amounts must also aggregate emissions for Failure to\nAttain Fee assessment. The baseline year, same 24-month consecutive period, or other\ntimeframe used to establish baseline amounts would be required as a basis for the baseline\namount calculation for all aggregated major stationary sources for each fee calculation.\nLike the baseline amount compliance schedule, major stationary sources that choose to\naggregate would submit the required forms and supporting documentation either on the\nemissions inventory due date of the fee assessment year, as specified under Emissions\nInventory Requirements in 30 TAC §101.10, or 120 days from the effective date of EPA’s failure\nto attain notice, whichever is later. Providing no less than 120 days for regulated entities to\nprepare aggregated baseline amounts allows flexibility for the executive director to implement\nthe final Failure to Attain Fee rule and initiate related business processes. For aggregation, a list\nof all sites under common control by RN aggregated under an baseline amount must be\nprovided in addition to the supporting documentation provided for individual baseline\namounts described under Baseline Amounts. If sites under common control chose to aggregate,\nthen those sites must share the same Customer Reference Number (CN) in TCEQ’s Central\nRegistry database. Sites under common control are determined by TCEQ. Sites not under\ncommon control according to TCEQ may not attempt to be combined in Central Registry with\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 40\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nthe intention of circumventing the Failure to Attain Fee, as addressed under circumvention\nrequirements of 30 TAC §101.3.\n§101.708, Adjustment of Baseline Amount for Major Sources with Less than 24 Months of\nOperation\nMajor stationary sources with less than 24 months of consecutive operation as of December 31\nof the baseline year or that began operation after the baseline year would not have sufficient\ndata to initially determine if emissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly\nfrom year to year to establish baseline emissions. The provisions of this proposed new section\nare intended to allow a major source with less than 24 months of consecutive operation an\nopportunity to adjust the established baseline amount after establishing the emissions history.\nAfter completing 24 months of consecutive operations, the major stationary source may\nrequest that the baseline amount be adjusted using the average rate during the first 24 months\nof consecutive operation for the baseline emissions. If the total annual authorizations\ndetermined the initial baseline amount and were still lower than the adjusted baseline\nemissions, then an adjustment may not be requested. If these emissions varied significantly\nduring the 24 months of consecutive operation, the emissions may be considered as irregular,\ncyclical, or otherwise varying significantly. Under the proposed rules, a major stationary source\nwould be allowed to request an adjustment to its established baseline amount within 90\ncalendar days of completing 24 months of consecutive operation. EPA published approval for a\nsimilar approach for new major stationary sources for the HGB Failure to Attain Fee in February\n2020.\nAll adjusted baseline amounts would be reviewed by the executive director’s staff to ensure\nconsistency with emissions information submitted to the TCEQ Air Permits Division and/or the\nAir Quality Division. Once finalized, the adjusted baseline amounts would apply starting with\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 41\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nthe next fee assessment year. Credits or refunds for previous fee assessment years would not\nbe processed based on the final adjustments. This ensures accounting stability for the Failure\nto Attain Fee.\n§101.709, Adjustment of Baseline Amount for New Construction\nThis proposed new section would allow an existing major stationary source to adjust its\nbaseline amount to account for new construction authorized in a nonattainment permit issued\nunder Chapter 116, Subchapter B, Division 5. These emissions units are required to provide\nemissions offsets prior to construction and comply with emissions limits that achieve the\nlowest achievable emissions rate. The newly constructed emissions units would not have been\nincluded in the previously established baseline amount. Under the proposed rules, a major\nstationary source would be allowed to request an adjustment to its established baseline amount\nwithin 90 calendar days of completed construction of the new emissions units.\nAll adjusted baseline amounts would be reviewed by the executive director’s staff to ensure\nconsistency with emissions information submitted to the TCEQ Air Permits Division and/or the\nAir Quality Division. . Once finalized, the adjusted baseline amounts would apply starting with\nthe next fee assessment year. Credits or refunds for previous fee assessment years would not\nbe processed based on the final adjustments. This ensures accounting stability for the Failure\nto Attain Fee.\n§101.710, Adjustment of Baseline Amount for Ownership Transfers\nThis proposed new section outlines when an established baseline amount may be adjusted\nbecause of ownership transfers. Emissions units may not always be under the same common\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 42\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nownership or control. Owners or operators of major stationary sources, as part of normal\nbusiness, may transfer ownership of some or all emissions units at a major stationary source or\nSection 185 Account to another major stationary source or Section 185 Account. The\ncommission recognizes that a change in ownership or control of emissions units could change\nthe Failure to Attain Fee owed for both major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts. The\nchange in control of emissions units does not change the historical operation, reported\nemissions of the emissions units, or previously invoiced amounts before the ownership transfer\noccurred. The ownership transfer must first be approved by and/or reported to the TCEQ Air\nPermits Division before adjustments of the baseline amounts could be requested.\nA change in control or ownership, such as with an emissions unit transfer, would not affect the\nalready established time period or baseline amounts on the remaining emissions units at either\nmajor stationary source or Section 185 Account. The already established baseline amounts\nwould be transferred from one major stationary source or Section 185 Account to the other\nmajor stationary source or Section 185 Account.\nIn a manner similar to transferring other obligations such as emissions authorizations, the\ncommission would allow the affected major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts to\ntransfer the baseline amounts and Failure to Attain Fee associated with each emissions unit\nhaving a change in control. The commission would not change the calculated baseline amounts\nfor the transferred emissions units or remaining emissions units.\nMajor stationary sources that transfer ownership of equipment from one major source or\nSection 185 Account to a minor source(s) would not have their baseline amounts adjusted to\nprevent circumvention of the Failure to Attain Fee, as addressed under 30 TAC §101.3.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 43\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nTo qualify for an ownership transfer baseline amount adjustment, the ownership transfer must\noccur between major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts of the same pollutant, or\naggregated pollutants, located within the same nonattainment area. For example, if an\nownership transfer occurred between a major source located in the 10-county DFW\nnonattainment area under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard and the eight-hour HGB\nnonattainment area under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, then the baseline amounts\ncould not be adjusted.\nAll adjusted baseline amounts would be reviewed by the executive director’s staff to ensure\nconsistency with emissions information submitted to the TCEQ Air Permits Division and/or the\nAir Quality Division. Once finalized, the adjusted baseline amounts would apply starting with\nthe next fee assessment year. Credits or refunds for previous fee assessment years would not\nbe processed based on the final adjustments. This ensures accounting stability for the Failure\nto Attain Fee.\nOnce finalized, the major stationary source or Section 185 Account that received the\nownership-transferred emissions units would add the unaltered baseline amounts from those\nunits to their existing major stationary source or Section 185 Account baseline amounts. There\nis no baseline amount adjustment for emissions units that were not ownership transferred at\nthe originating or recipient major source. The major stationary source or Section 185 Account\nthat transferred the emissions units would subtract the transferred emissions units’ baseline\namounts from their major stationary source or Section 185 Account baseline amount. While\nbaseline amounts may increase or decrease at a major stationary source or Section 185 Account\nresulting from ownership transfers, the overall Area §185 Obligation for the nonattainment\narea would not change.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 44\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nTo transfer the baseline and the Failure to Attain Fee, the new owner or operator of each major\nstationary source or Section 185 Account affected by the change in common control would be\nrequired to submit a request to the executive director within 90 days of the ownership change\nfor the executive director’s approval.\n§101.711, Adjustment of Baseline Amount for Final Emissions Inventory Data\nThis proposed new section addresses the situation when baseline emissions may need to be\nadjusted upon the availability of final quality assured and TCEQ-approved emissions inventory\ndata. The Failure to Attain Fee would be implemented upon the effective date of EPA’s finding\nof failure to attain notice published in the Federal Register for a severe or extreme ozone\nnonattainment area under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard that fails to attain by the\nattainment date. It is unknown when EPA would issue the finding of failure to attain; therefore,\nthe specific dates to establish an initial baseline amount are unknown. Because of\nimplementation timing, final quality assured and TCEQ-approved emissions inventory data\ncould occur after the baseline amount is established. If a major stationary source had used\nemissions inventory data to establish the baseline amount, then TCEQ may request adjustments\nbased on the final quality assured emissions inventory data.\nAdditionally, major stationary sources may initiate emissions inventory revisions that require\nbaseline amount adjustments. Due to limited staff resources, approval of regulated entity-\ninitiated requests would be based on the revisions guidance in the Emissions Inventory\nGuidelines published annually and posted on the Point Source Emissions Inventory webpage\nlocated at (https://www.tceq.texas.gov/airquality/point-source-ei/psei.html). Emissions inventory\ndata are used extensively for air quality planning purposes, such as SIP revisions and rule\ndevelopment, submitting to required federal programs, such as the NEI, and assessment of\nother applicable fees such as the Title V fees. For these reasons, emissions inventory revisions\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 45\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nare allowed for specific circumstances. Emissions inventory revisions submitted solely for the\npurpose of adjusting a baseline amount would not be accepted.\nRegulated entities, including major sources, are provided an opportunity to review and if\nnecessary, revise emissions data submitted for the current emissions inventory reporting year\nand for one year immediately prior. Major stationary sources would have 90 days or by March\n31 of the calendar year immediately following the emissions inventory reporting year,\nwhichever comes first, to submit adjusted baseline amount requests due to final, quality-\nassured emissions data. Revisions to historical emissions inventory data outside of this\ntimeframe are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, usually as the result of a TCEQ-directed\nemissions inventory improvement project or TCEQ’s compliance and enforcement process.\nAll adjusted baseline amounts would be reviewed by the executive director’s staff to ensure\nconsistency with final emissions information submitted to the TCEQ Air Permits Division\nand/or the Air Quality Division. Once finalized, the adjusted baseline amounts would apply\nstarting with the next fee assessment year. Credits or refunds for previous fee assessment\nyears would not be processed based on the final adjustments. This ensures accounting stability\nfor the Failure to Attain Fee.\n§101.712, Failure to Establish a Fee Baseline Amount\nThis proposed new section outlines the procedures for the executive director to establish a\nbaseline amount. Timely and accurate baseline amounts are required from each applicable\nmajor stationary source to implement the FCAA-required Section 185 fee program. If a major\nstationary source does not submit an approvable baseline amount by the due date specified by\nthe executive director, then the executive director would determine baseline amount(s) for that\nmajor stationary source. In accordance with the requirements of FCAA, §185, the lower of\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 46\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nactual emissions (reported in the emissions inventory as described in §101.705) or allowable\nemissions (permits or authorizations) from the attainment year (referenced as baseline year in\nthis proposed rulemaking), would be used, if both were available, to determine separate\nbaseline amounts for each pollutant that determined major source applicability. Since the\nexecutive director would not have sufficient information, aggregation by pollutant or sites\nunder common control and any adjustments allowed under this proposed rulemaking would\nnot be used.\nIf available, emissions inventory data reported under 30 TAC §101.10 would be used for\ndetermining the baseline emissions. However, if only permit allowable data are available, a\nbaseline amount would be established as 12.5 tons for VOC and/or 12.5 tons for NO\nX\n(depending on the pollutant(s) that determined major source applicability) until the major\nstationary source submitted an approvable baseline amount. Allowable (permits or\nauthorizations) emissions are typically higher than the actual emissions reported in the\nemissions inventory. FCAA, §185 requires the lower of actual or allowable emissions, so the\nexecutive director would establish the baseline emissions from the unavailable emissions\ninventory as 12.5 tons, which represents one-half of the major stationary source threshold of\n25 tons. If the executive director used the allowable emissions from the permit to establish the\nbaseline amount, then the non-compliant major stationary source would gain the advantage of\na higher baseline amount by not reporting their actual emissions.\nIf the executive director establishes the baseline amounts, then those baseline amounts would\nbe applicable until the major stationary source submits a verifiable and complete emissions\ninventory according to the Emissions Inventory Requirements of 30 TAC §101.10 and baseline\namount. After the major stationary source submits a baseline amount and the executive\ndirector reviews the baseline amount to ensure consistency with emissions information\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 47\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nsubmitted to the TCEQ Air Permits Division and/or the Air Quality Division, the final baseline\namount would apply starting with the next fee assessment year. Adjustments to previous fee\ninvoices based on baseline amounts established by the executive director would not be allowed.\n§101.713, Failure to Attain Fee Assessment\nThe proposed new section outlines the method used to assess the Failure to Attain Fee (total\nfee) for VOC or NO emissions, or both. If the major stationary source is major for just one\nX\npollutant, the total fee would be assessed for just the one pollutant, VOC or NO . If the major\nX\nstationary source is major for both VOC and NO emissions, the total fee would be assessed for\nX\nboth pollutants.\nThis proposed new section also provides for the total fee calculation for owners or operators of\nmajor stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts. Fee assessments must follow the same\nmethod chosen for the baseline amount determination. The total fee from VOC and/or NO\nX\nemissions from a major stationary source that is major for one pollutant and does not have\nmultiple sites under common control, does not choose to aggregate baseline amounts, or does\nnot comply with the provisions of proposed §101.707 would remain separate and due from\neach major stationary source or Section 185 Account. The total fee for owners or operators of\nmajor stationary sources that choose to aggregate VOC and/or NO emissions would also be\nX\ndue according to the provisions of this proposed section. The aggregation of VOC with NO\nX\nemissions may occur at one major stationary source or across multiple major stationary\nsources under common control. Because both pollutants were used to aggregate a baseline\namount, the total fee would be due on actual emissions of both VOC and NO emissions.\nX\nConsistency between the baseline amount determination and the total fee calculation would be\nmaintained with this approach. An owner or operator of multiple sources under common\ncontrol who chooses to combine a single pollutant from multiple major stationary sources in a\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 48\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nbaseline amount must aggregate actual emissions of that single pollutant in the total fee\npayment. If an owner or operator opted to combine VOC with NO emissions at a major\nX\nstationary source, both VOC and NO emissions must be aggregated for the total fee payment.\nX\nSimilarly, owners or operators who choose to combine VOC and NO emissions in a baseline\nX\namount and to aggregate those pollutants across more than one major stationary source must\ncombine actual VOC and NO emissions from all aggregated major stationary sources to\nX\ndetermine the total fee. For example, if five major stationary sources of both VOC and NO\nX\nemissions elected to aggregate into one Section 185 fee account to determine the NO baseline\nX\namount, then the total NO portion of the fee payment would be based on all actual reported\nX\nNO emissions from those five major stationary sources. Since the five major stationary sources\nX\ndid not elect to aggregate VOC emissions into one baseline amount, then the total fee payment\nfor VOC emissions would be assessed separately for the five different Section 185 fee accounts\nusing actual reported VOC emissions for these major stationary sources. Similarly, if owners or\noperators choose to combine multiple major stationary sources into one baseline amount for\nVOC and NO emissions, then the total fee payment would be due from the combined major\nX\nstationary sources for both pollutants together.\nThe total fee would be applicable to and calculated for each pollutant (VOC or NO ) for which\nX\nthe major source meets the applicability requirements of this proposed rulemaking from the\nactual emissions reported in the emissions inventory for the fee assessment year. The fee\namount assessed, calculated, and invoiced would be based on the actual emissions from the fee\nassessment year’s emissions inventory that exceeded 80% of the baseline amount, rounded up\nto the nearest whole number. If the actual emissions reported in the emissions inventory are\nless than 80% of the baseline amount, then the fee would be assessed at $0.00 dollars and no\nfee payment would be due from that major stationary source or Section 185 Account for that\nfee assessment year for that pollutant. For future fee assessment years, the fee would be due if\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 49\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nthe actual emissions reported in the emissions inventory exceeded 80% of the baseline amount.\nRounding up to the nearest whole number is standard practice for fee assessment since\nassessing fees on fractional amounts creates fee amounts with several decimal places that can\ncause errors in the fee invoice data systems, which accept only two decimal places. An example\nof rounding up to the nearest whole number would be the fee assessment amount calculated as\n10.0319 tons, rounding up to the nearest whole number, the fee would be assessed and\ninvoiced on 11 tons.\nThe total fee for a pollutant aggregated under multiple major stationary sources for a baseline\namount would be calculated based on the aggregated actual emissions from all the affected\nmajor stationary sources minus 80% of the aggregated baseline amounts for all major\nstationary sources, rounded up to the nearest whole number.\nWhile baseline amounts exclude unauthorized emissions, fee assessments would be based on\nactual emissions, as defined in 30 TAC §101.10, which includes emissions from annual routine\noperations, MSS operations, and other events not otherwise authorized (emissions from\nemissions events or MSS activities). Inclusion of unauthorized emissions in fee assessment is\nappropriate because the emissions contribute to the formation of ozone in the nonattainment\narea during the year that the fee is owed. Inclusion of unauthorized emissions in fee\nassessment is also required in TCEQ’s emissions fee rule in 30 TAC §101.27, which requires all\nMSS and emissions event emissions to be included in fee calculations.\nFCAA, §185 requires the annual fee to be adjusted by the consumer price index (CPI) and cross\nreferences the methodology in FCAA, §502(b)(3)(B)(3)(v). The method described in FCAA, §502\nrequires the fee to be adjusted annually per the CPI for all-urban consumers published by the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 50\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nUnited States Department of Labor, as of the close of the 12-month period ending on August 31\nof each calendar year. FCAA, §185 requires these fees to be assessed on a calendar-year basis,\nand the inflation factor based on the CPI is applied in September for the fiscal year (based on\nthe previous September through August data). Therefore, the calendar year Failure to Attain Fee\nis determined as a weighted monthly average (two thirds of the fee associated with January\nthrough August and one third of the fee associated with September through December). For\nexample, a 2028 calendar-year fee would span the 2028 fiscal year and the 2029 fiscal year.\nThus, a calendar-year 2028 fee requires two thirds of the annual CPI ending in August 2028 and\none third of the annual CPI ending in August 2029. The commission proposes this methodology\nto calculate the fee from EPA’s guidance memo (Page 10, available at\n(https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-\n09/documents/1hour_ozone_nonattainment_guidance.pdf). The proposed fee calculation uses\nthe 40 CFR Part 70 Presumptive Minimum fee basis from EPA’s guidance memo. The Part 70 fee\nrate is published annually by EPA and is available at (https://www.epa.gov/title-v-operating-\npermits/permit-fees). The Part 70 fee is the rate used to calculate emissions-based fees for Part\n70 permit programs. Rather than calculating the rate directly from the CPI, the proposed\nmethod uses the Part 70 fee rate published by EPA. The Part 70 fee already has the required CPI\nadjustment incorporated into it.\nThe timing of the fee assessment depends on the effective date of EPA’s finding of failure to\nattain. For the 10-county DFW and eight-county HGB 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment\nareas, 2028 is the first year after the attainment date of July 20, 2027. Since the 2027 emissions\ninventories would be due in 2028, TCEQ staff would have until the end of 2028 to complete the\nquality assurance reviews of the 2027 annual emissions inventories that would be used to\ndetermine the baseline amount. Major sources would require time to establish the baseline\namounts based on final emissions reported in the 2027 emissions inventory. TCEQ staff would\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 51\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nrequire time to quality assure the baseline amounts submitted by each major source. To\nestablish and quality assure the baseline amounts, the fee collection year would generally be\nproposed as two calendar years following the fee assessment year. A potential scenario could\ninclude regulated entities submitting the 2027 emissions inventories by the March 31, 2028,\ndue date, and TCEQ staff completing the quality assurance reviews of the 2027 emissions\ninventories by the end of calendar year 2028. If the area(s) fail to attain the 2008 eight-hour\nozone standard, and EPA finalizes a failure to attain notice in October 2027, then, following\nEPA’s effective date of the failure to attain notice, TCEQ could provide a courtesy electronic\nnotification to regulated entities that major sources must submit their baseline amount to\nTCEQ by March 31, 2028. TCEQ staff would quality assure the 2027 baseline amounts during\ncalendar year 2028. The 2028 emissions inventories are due by April 2, 2029 (since March 31,\n2029, falls on a Saturday), and TCEQ staff would complete the quality assurance process for the\n2028 emissions inventories by the end of calendar year 2029. TCEQ would implement the\ncalendar-year 2028 Section 185 fee rate once EPA publishes it, typically by the end of October\neach year. Assuming EPA publishes the 2028 Section 185 fee rate in October 2028, TCEQ would\nthen assess the calendar-year 2028 fees in late 2029 and prepare and send invoices in early\ncalendar-year 2030. As a result, calendar year 2030 becomes the first fee collection year for the\nfirst fee assessment year of 2028, based on the actual emissions reported in the 2028 emissions\ninventory.\nA major stationary source subject to the requirements of this proposed rulemaking would also\nbe required to submit an annual emissions inventory according to §101.10. The annual fee\nassessment requires the submission of the emissions inventory by the due date to invoice the\nsource on actual emissions of VOC, NO , or both for that fee assessment year. Regulated\nX\nentities subject to the Section 185 fee that do not submit an emissions inventory by the due\ndate would be subject to enforcement.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 52\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n§101.714, Failure to Attain Fee Payment\nThis proposed section stipulates that payment of the Failure to Attain Fee must be made by\ncheck, certified check, electronic funds transfer, or money order made payable to TCEQ.\nPayment must be sent to the TCEQ address provided on the billing statement by the date\nspecified on the invoice. Generally, sites will have a minimum of 30 days to pay the invoice.\nThis proposed rule would impose interest and penalties in accordance with 30 TAC Chapter 12\nto owners or operators of major sources subject to the applicability provisions of this proposed\nsubchapter who fail to make full payment of the Failure to Attain Fees by the due date.\n§101.715, Eligibility for Other Failure to Attain Fee Fulfillment Options\nThis proposed new section would allow major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts\nrequired to pay a Failure to Attain Fee (total fee) to partially or completely fulfill the total fee\nowed by relinquishing emissions credits or using Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs)\ninstead of issuing full payment. These other fulfillment options could be considered individual\nfee offsets for major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts. The amount of emissions\ntonnage upon which the total fee is owed or the total fee amount owed would be reduced for\nthe major stationary source or Section 185 Account while the nonattainment area receives\nemissions reductions benefits. If relinquishing emissions credits or using SEPs does not\ncompletely fulfill the entire fee owed by a major stationary source or Section 185 Account, the\nremaining portion of the total fee remains due according to the Failure to Attain Fee Payment\nsection of this proposed rulemaking.\nAs explained previously in this preamble, the implementation of the Section 185 fee program\ndepends on several future factors including the effective date of EPA’s finding of failure to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 53\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nattain action. According to proposed §101.714, the invoice due date would be provided by the\nexecutive director after the program is implemented. The commission must be timely informed\nif other options would be requested to fulfill the total fee. The commission proposes that the\nemissions inventory due date specified under the Emissions Inventory Requirements of 30 TAC\n§101.10 for the fee assessment year would be the proposed date that major stationary sources\nor Section 185 Account must inform the executive director that these other fulfillment options\nwould be used. Further, the commission proposes that the emissions inventory due date\nspecified under the Emissions Inventory Requirements of 30 TAC §101.10 for the fee\nassessment year would be the proposed date allowances traded under §101.716 must be\napproved and completed, and SEPs, under §101.717, must be approved and funded. If other\nfulfillment options under §101.716 are not approved and funded, exercised, or otherwise\ncompleted by the emissions inventory due date, these other fulfillment options would not be\neligible to be applied to the total fee. Because a SEP may be a capital project requiring more\nthan 30 days to complete, SEPs must be approved and funded by the emissions inventory due\ndate. All requests to use a SEP as the other option to fulfill the total fee would be subject to the\nexecutive director’s approval to ensure applicability to the nonattainment area.\n§101.716, Relinquishing Credits to Fulfill a Failure to Attain Fee\nThis proposed new section allows major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts to request\nto fulfill all or a portion of their Failure to Attain Fee (total fee) by relinquishing an equivalent\nportion of emission reduction credits, discrete emission reduction credits, current or banked\nHighly-Reactive Volatile Organic Compound (HRVOC) Emissions Cap and Trade (HECT) program\nallowances, or current or banked Mass Emissions Cap and Trade (MECT) program allowances.\nEmission credits submitted for total fee reduction purposes, on a ton-for-ton basis, would only\nbe allowed for use as a fulfillment option for the pollutant (VOC or NO ) specified on the credit.\nX\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 54\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nVOC credits or HECT allowances must only be used as a fulfillment option for VOC tons in\nexcess of the baseline; NO credits must only be used as a fulfillment option for NO tons. The\nX X\nuse of allowances would be similarly restricted such that MECT allowances would only be used\nas an equivalent for NO tons. HECT allowances would only be allowed for use as an equivalent\nX\nfor VOC tons in excess of the baseline amount for major stationary sources or Section 185\nAccounts located in the 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area. Significant digit rounding\nof the emissions reduction must be limited to one-tenth of a ton. Removing these emissions,\nrepresented as allowances, on a ton-per-ton basis furthers the goals of reducing ozone-causing\nemissions in the atmosphere and meets the objective of improving air quality by reducing\nemissions more directly than imposing a fee.\n§101.717, Using a Supplemental Environmental Project to Fulfill a Failure to Attain Fee\nThis proposed new section allows major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts to request\nto fulfill all or part of their Failure to Attain Fee (total fee) by contributing to a SEP within the\n2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area where the major stationary source or Section 185\nAccount is located. SEPs are projects that prevent or reduce pollution beyond existing\nregulatory requirements. Supporting a SEP guaranteeing emissions reductions in the\nnonattainment area would provide cost-effective opportunities that more directly benefit air\nquality in the affected area than the imposition of a fee. Under this proposed rule, contributing\nto a SEP would reduce a major stationary source’s or Section 185 Account’s Failure to Attain Fee\non a dollar-per-dollar or ton-by-ton basis. As proposed, the rule would also allow a major\nstationary source or Section 185 Account to use surplus SEP funds from year to year. The\nfunding would not be discounted or depreciated over time.\nThe proposed rule language would only allow funding for air-related projects that are\nimplemented within the same 2008 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area. For example, in the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 55\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n10-county DFW nonattainment area under the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard, SEPs are\nrestricted to fulfillment options for major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts located\nin the DFW nonattainment area. This rule would restrict SEPs to projects that offset the Failure\nto Attain Fee on a dollar-per-dollar or ton-by-ton basis. The established SEP program requires\nparticipants to submit quarterly and annual project reports with expenditure and project\ncompletion information, providing validation of actual emissions reductions or expenditures.\nBecause a SEP can be used to offset an administrative penalty, it is inappropriate for those\nfunds to also be used for credit or offset for the Failure to Attain Fee. For many SEPs, only half\nthe dollar amount of the SEP may be used to offset an administrative penalty. The use of Failure\nto Attain Fee credit from the SEP would be restricted to be the portion of funds not used to\noffset an administrative penalty. The SEP must also be enforceable through an Agreed Order or\nother enforceable document to ensure compliance with the SEP objectives.\n§101.718, Cessation of Program\nThis proposed new section outlines the circumstances that would end the Failure to Attain Fee\nfor an applicable nonattainment area. FCAA, §185 requires the penalty fee to be collected until\nredesignation of the nonattainment area to attainment by EPA, any final action or final\nrulemaking by EPA to end the Failure to Attain fee, or a finding of attainment by EPA. After EPA\nredesignates an area to attainment and publishes the final approval of the attainment\nredesignation in the Federal Register, the Failure to Attain Fee would no longer be applicable to\nthat ozone nonattainment area as of the effective date specified in the Federal Register.\nAdditionally, to provide for timely cessation of the Failure to Attain Fee program, the\ncommission proposes that the Failure to Attain Fee would be assessed, but the fee collection\nwould be placed in abeyance by the executive director if three years of quality-assured data\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 56\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nresulting in a design value that did not exceed the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard are\nsubmitted to EPA. The commission also proposes as part of this design value determination,\nthe ability to exclude days that exceeded the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard because of\nexceptional events or emissions emanating outside the United States.\nFiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government\nKyle Girten, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the first five-\nyear period the proposed rules are in effect, fiscal implications may result for TCEQ and other\nunits of government during implementation of the proposed rule.\nIf DFW and/or HGB areas do not attain the 2008 eight-hour NAAQS by July 20, 2027 or EPA\ndoes not abolish the program, these areas would be subject to the Section 185 fee in the\nproposed rulemaking (30 TAC Subchapter K. If this is the case, TCEQ currently estimates it\nwould require the addition of three full-time-equivalents (FTEs) beginning in FY 2028 and for\nthe update and maintenance of a database for tracking information as applicable to TCEQ’s 185\nfee program. It is anticipated that the three FTEs would include a Natural Resources Specialist\n(NRS) V (B24) and two NRS IVs (B22) in years 3 and 4 (FY 2028 and FY 2029), and two FTEs (one\nNRS V and one NRS IV) in year 5 (FY 2030) as necessary to implement the program. These staff\nwould develop and implement business processes for (1) establishing and maintaining a fee\nequivalency account (§§101.703-704), (2) establishing baseline determinations using data\nsubmitted by regulated entities (§§101.705-712), (3) annually assessing and collecting fees\nbased on data from annual emissions inventories (§§101.713-714), (4) reviewing and assessing\nfee payments (§§101.715-717), and (5) updating and maintaining the database for the program.\nThe total cost for FTEs, including salaries and other costs, but excluding fringe and payroll\ncosts is estimated at $277,818 in FY 2028, $252,318 in FY 2029, and $171,920 in FY 2030. It is\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 57\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nestimated that $250,000 will be needed annually for the update of the Section 185 database in\nFY 2028 and FY 2029, and $50,000 would be needed in FY 2030. In summary, it is anticipated\nthere will be no costs to TCEQ during the first two years the rules are in effect, and the total\ncost to TCEQ is estimated at $527,818 in FY 2028, $502,318 in FY 2029, and $221,920 in FY\n2030.\nTCEQ may receive revenue from fees that may be required of entities that include major\nstationary sources of VOC and/or NO emissions in these areas. Whether fees will ultimately be\nX\nassessed as a result of this rulemaking is dependent on how baselines are determined for the\nHGB and DFW sources (§§101.705-712), actual emissions for each year when fees are assessed\n(§§101.713-714), the amount of TERP revenue in these areas that is eligible to offset fee\nobligations (§§101.703-704), whether and to what extent equivalent alternatives are used in lieu\nof fee payments (§§101.715-717), and the unit cost per ton of VOC and/or NO emissions billed\nX\nas required by FCAA, §182(d)(3) and (e) and §185.\nIt is noted that when the Section 185 fee program was implemented for the HGB one-hour\nozone severe nonattainment area for major sources of VOC and/or NO emissions, TERP\nX\nrevenue was sufficient to offset all fee obligations every year fees were required to be assessed\n(calendar years 2012-2019), and TCEQ did not invoice fees during this timeframe. For this\nrulemaking, TCEQ estimates that between $0 - $129,000,000 in revenue will be received\nannually during the third, fourth, and fifth years after the proposed rules are in effect.\nThis estimate was derived using the 2023 fee rate from EPA ($11,922 per ton VOC and/or NO )\nX\nadjusted to increase by an assumed inflation rate of 2.5% between 2023 and 2028. For DFW,\nrevenue received by TCEQ is estimated to be between $0 - $5,000,000 each year starting in\n2028, assuming TCEQ receives the lowest amount of eligible TERP revenue for this area in the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 58\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\npast ten years ($42,000,000). For HGB, revenue received is estimated to be between $0 -\n$124,000,000, assuming TCEQ receives the lowest amount of eligible TERP revenue for this area\nin the past ten years ($47,000,000).\nFiscal implications for other governmental entities would be dependent on whether fees need to\nbe assessed for major stationary sources in the DFW and/or HGB areas. Affected entities\ninclude major stationary sources of VOC and/or NO emissions in these areas. In the DFW area,\nX\nit is estimated that eight landfills, one university, and one sewage facility are governmental\nentities that would meet eligibility requirements. In HGB, it is estimated that six landfills, two\nuniversities, one research facility, and four sewage facilities would meet eligibility requirements\nEntities for DFW and/or HGB would be required to submit baseline information for VOC and/or\nNO , and prorated based on TERP offsets, they would be responsible for pay the annual Section\nX\n185 fee or apply equivalent alternatives based on their actual emissions over baseline amounts.\nPublic Benefits and Costs\nMr. Girten determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are in effect,\nthe public benefit anticipated will be compliance with federal law. If this rulemaking were not\nto occur, in accordance with FCAA, §185(d), EPA would have the ability to impose and collect\nthe fee with interest, and this revenue would not be returned to the state. Additionally,\nalthough the Section 185 fee is a penalty and not a control strategy, the magnitude of the fee\ncould potentially incentivize major stationary sources to reduce ozone precursor emissions in\nthe DFW and/or HGB nonattainment areas.\nThis rulemaking may have fiscal impacts on 461 major stationary sources, including the 23\ngovernmental sources noted above. These sources are from a range of industrial source\ncategories, with the most common categories being industrial organic chemicals, crude\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 59\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\npetroleum and natural gas, electric services, petroleum bulk stations and terminals, special\nwarehousing and storage, natural gas liquids, plastic materials and synthetic resins, refuse\nsystems, refined petroleum pipelines, petroleum refining, industrial gases, and natural gas\ntransmission. As noted above, the fee per sources is dependent on multiple factors, and the\ntotal impact for DFW and HGB areas could range from $0 - $129,000,000 annually during the\nthird, fourth, and fifth years after the proposed rules are in effect.\nLocal Employment Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Local Employment\nImpact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking is not anticipated to\nadversely affect a local economy in a significant way for the first five years that the proposed\nrule is in effect. While the magnitude of fees assessed has the potential to be high in the DFW\nand HGB areas, the number of businesses and governmental entities affected is very small in\nproportion to the overall number of industries and business and governmental entities in these\nareas. It is unknown whether and to what extent this rulemaking would affect business\ndecisions made by entities directly affected by this rule.\nRural Communities Impact Assessment\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first five\nyears that the proposed rules are in effect. This rulemaking applies to DFW and HGB areas,\nwhich are areas with large populations; therefore, rural communities are not significantly\nimpacted.\nSmall Business and Micro-Business Assessment\nNo adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro-businesses due to the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 60\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nimplementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period the\nproposed rules are in effect. No small businesses have been identified that would be affected by\nthis rulemaking.\nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Small Business\nRegulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does not adversely\naffect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years the proposed rules are\nin effect.\nGovernment Growth Impact Statement\nThe commission prepared a Government Growth Impact Statement assessment for this\nproposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a government\nprogram and may require a request for an increase in future legislative appropriations to the\nagency. The proposed rulemaking is anticipated to require the creation of new employee\npositions, and it may increase fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking establishes a\nnew regulation, with major sources of VOC or NO emissions in the DFW and/or HGB areas\nX\nsubject to its applicability. During the first five years, the proposed rule should not impact\npositively or negatively the state’s economy, particularly if TERP revenue is sufficient to offset\nthe Section 185 fee obligation.\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking considering the regulatory impact analysis\nrequirements of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225 and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not meet the definition of a “Major environmental rule” as defined in that\nstatute, and in addition, if it did meet the definition, would not be subject to the requirement to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 61\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nprepare a regulatory impact analysis. A “Major environmental rule” means a rule, the specific\nintent of which is to protect the environment or reduce risks to human health from\nenvironmental exposure, and that may adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector\nof the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and\nsafety of the state or a sector of the state. Additionally, the proposed rulemaking does not meet\nany of the four applicability criteria for requiring a regulatory impact analysis for a “Major\nenvironmental rule”, which are listed in Texas Government Code, §2001.0225(a). Texas\nGovernment Code, § 2001.0225 applies only to a “Major environmental rule”, the result of\nwhich is to: 1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by\nstate law; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically required\nby federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract between the state\nand an agency or representative of the federal government to implement a state and federal\nprogram; or 4) adopt a rule solely under the general powers of the agency instead of under a\nspecific state law.\nThe specific intent of the proposed rules is to comply with the requirements of 42 U.S.C.\n§7511a and §7511d (FCAA, §182 and §185) for the DFW and HGB 2008 ozone nonattainment\nareas, as discussed further elsewhere in this preamble. Penalty fee programs are a required\ncomponent of SIPs for ozone nonattainment areas that are classified as severe or extreme. Fees\nare required to be collected for all major stationary sources in severe or extreme ozone\nnonattainment areas that do not attain the ozone standard by their attainment dates. If the fee\nis not imposed and collected by the state, then 42 U.S.C. §7511d(d) (FCAA, §185(d)) requires\nthat the EPA shall impose and collect the fee (and may collect interest). The applicability of the\nfee may have a benefit in reducing emissions of ozone precursors in ozone nonattainment\nareas by incentivizing sources to reduce emissions further, but the proposed rules will not\nrequire emission reduction.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 62\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nStates are required to adopt State Implementation Plans (SIPs) with enforceable emission\nlimitations and other control measures, means, or techniques, as well as schedules and\ntimetables for compliance, as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable\nrequirements of the FCAA. As discussed in the FISCAL NOTE portion of this preamble, the\nproposed rules are not anticipated to add any significant additional costs to affected\nindividuals or businesses beyond what is necessary to comply with federal law on the economy,\na sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health\nand safety of the state or a sector of the state. If a state does not comply with its obligations\nunder 42 USC, §7410 (FCAA, §110) to submit SIPs, states are subject to discretionary sanctions\nunder 42 USC, §7410(m) (FCAA, §110(m)) or mandatory sanctions under 42 USC, §7509 (FCAA,\n§179); as well as the imposition of a federal implementation plan (FIP) under 42 USC, §7410\n(FCAA, §110(c)).\nThe requirement to provide a fiscal analysis of regulations in the Texas Government Code was\namended by Senate Bill (SB) 633 during the 75th legislative session. The intent of SB 633 was to\nrequire agencies to conduct a regulatory impact analysis of extraordinary rules. These are\nidentified in the statutory language as major environmental rules that will have a material\nadverse impact and will exceed a requirement of state law, federal law, or a delegated federal\nprogram, or are adopted solely under the general powers of the agency. With the understanding\nthat this requirement would seldom apply, the commission provided a cost estimate for SB 633\nthat concluded \"based on an assessment of rules adopted by the agency in the past, it is not\nanticipated that the bill will have significant fiscal implications for the agency due to its limited\napplication.\" The commission also noted that the number of rules that would require\nassessment under the provisions of the bill was not large. This conclusion was based, in part,\non the criteria set forth in the bill that exempted rules from the full analysis unless the rule was\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 63\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\na major environmental rule that exceeds a federal law. Because of the ongoing need to meet\nfederal requirements, the commission routinely proposes and adopts rules incorporating or\ndesigned to satisfy specific federal requirements. The legislature is presumed to understand\nthis federal scheme. If each rule proposed by the commission to meet a federal requirement\nwas a major environmental rule that exceeds federal law, then each of those rules would\nrequire the full regulatory impact analysis contemplated by SB 633. Requiring a full regulatory\nimpact analysis for all federally required rules is inconsistent with the conclusions reached by\nthe commission in its cost estimate and by the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) in its fiscal notes.\nSince the legislature is presumed to understand the fiscal impacts of the bills it passes, and\nthat presumption is based on information provided by state agencies and the LBB, the that the\nintent of SB 633 was only to require the full regulatory impact analysis for rules that are\nextraordinary in nature. While the proposed rules may have a broad impact, that impact is no\ngreater than is necessary or appropriate to meet the requirements of the FCAA, and in fact\ncreates no additional impacts since the proposed rules do not impose burdens greater than\nrequired to comply with federal law, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble. For these\nreasons, the proposed rules fall under the exception in Texas Government Code, §2001.0225(a),\nbecause they are required by, and do not exceed, federal law. The commission has consistently\napplied this construction to its rules since this statute was enacted in 1997. Since that time, the\nlegislature has revised the Texas Government Code, but left this provision substantially\nunamended. It is presumed that \"when an agency interpretation is in effect at the time the\nlegislature amends the laws without making substantial change in the statute, the legislature is\ndeemed to have accepted the agency’s interpretation.\" (Central Power & Light Co. v. Sharp, 919\nS.W.2d 485, 489 (Tex. App. Austin 1995), writ denied with per curiam opinion respecting\nanother issue, 960 S.W.2d 617 (Tex. 1997); Bullock v. Marathon Oil Co., 798 S.W.2d 353, 357\n(Tex. App. Austin 1990, no writ). Cf. Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Calvert, 414 S.W.2d 172 (Tex.\n1967); Dudney v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 9 S.W.3d 884, 893 (Tex. App. Austin 2000);\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 64\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nSouthwestern Life Ins. Co. v. Montemayor, 24 S.W.3d 581 (Tex. App. Austin 2000, pet. denied);\nand Coastal Indust. Water Auth. v. Trinity Portland Cement Div., 563 S.W.2d 916 (Tex. 1978).)\nThe commission’s interpretation of the regulatory impact analysis requirements is also\nsupported by a change made to the Texas Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by the legislature\nin 1999. In an attempt to limit the number of rule challenges based upon APA requirements, the\nlegislature clarified that state agencies are required to meet these sections of the APA applying\nthe standard of \"substantial compliance\" specified in Texas Government Code, §2001.035. The\nlegislature specifically identified Texas Government Code, §2001.0225 as falling under this\nstandard.\nAs presented in this analysis and elsewhere in this preamble, the evidence supports the\nconclusion that the commission has substantially complied with the requirements of Texas\nGovernment Code, §2001.0225. The proposed rules implement the requirements of the FCAA\nas discussed in this analysis and elsewhere in this preamble. The proposed rules were\ndetermined to be necessary to comply with federal law and will not exceed any standard set by\nstate or federal law. These proposed rules are not an express requirement of state law. The\nproposed rules do not exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or a contract between\nstate and federal government, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the commission and\napproved by EPA, will become federal law as part of the approved SIP required by 42 U.S.C.\n§7410 (FCAA, §110). The proposed rules were not developed solely under the general powers of\nthe agency but are authorized by specific sections of Texas Health and Safety Code (THSC),\nChapter 382 (also known as the Texas Clean Air Act), and the Texas Water Code, which are cited\nin the STATUTORY AUTHORITY section of this preamble, including THSC, §§382.011, 382.012,\nand 382.017. Therefore, this proposed rulemaking action is not subject to the regulatory\nanalysis provisions of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225(b).\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 65\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nThe commission invites public comment regarding the Draft Regulatory Impact Analysis\nDetermination during the public comment period. Written comments on the Draft Regulatory\nImpact Analysis Determination may be submitted to the contact person at the address listed\nunder the Submittal of Comments section of this preamble.\nTakings Impact Assessment\nUnder Texas Government Code, §2007.002(5), taking means a governmental action that affects\nprivate real property, in whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a manner that\nrequires the governmental entity to compensate the private real property owner as provided by\nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution or §17 or §19, Article I,\nTexas Constitution; or a governmental action that affects an owner’s private real property that\nis the subject of the governmental action, in whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in\na manner that restricts or limits the owner’s right to the property that would otherwise exist in\nthe absence of the governmental action; and is the producing cause of a reduction of at least 25\npercent in the market value of the affected private real property, determined by comparing the\nmarket value of the property as if the governmental action is not in effect and the market value\nof the property determined as if the governmental action is in effect. The commission\ncompleted a takings impact analysis for the proposed rulemaking action under the Texas\nGovernment Code, §2007.043.\nThe primary purpose of this proposed rulemaking action, as discussed elsewhere in this\npreamble, is to meet federal requirements for the inclusion of penalty fee programs for major\nstationary sources in State Implementation Plans (SIPs) as mandated by 42 United States Code\n(USC), §§7410, 7511a, and 7511d (Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), §§110, 182 and 185). Penalty\nfee programs are a required component of SIPs for ozone nonattainment areas that are\nclassified as severe or extreme. Fees are required to be collected for all major stationary\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 66\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nsources in severe or extreme ozone nonattainment areas that do not attain the ozone standard\nby their attainment dates. If the fee is not imposed and collected by the state, then 42 U.S.C.\n§7511d(d) (FCAA, §185(d)) requires that the EPA shall impose and collect the fee (and may\ncollect interest). The applicability of the fee may have a benefit in reducing emissions of ozone\nprecursors in ozone nonattainment areas by incentivizing sources to reduce emissions further,\nbut the proposed rules will not require emission reduction.\nStates are required to adopt SIPs with enforceable emission limitations and other control\nmeasures, means, or techniques, as well as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may be\nnecessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements of the FCAA. If a state does not\ncomply with its obligations under 42 USC, §7410 (FCAA, §110) to submit SIPs, states are subject\nto discretionary sanctions under 42 USC, §7410(m) (FCAA, §110(m)) or mandatory sanctions\nunder 42 USC, §7509 (FCAA, §179); as well as the imposition of a federal implementation plan\n(FIP) under 42 USC, §7410(c) (FCAA, §110(c)).\nThe proposed rules will not create any additional burden on private real property beyond what\nis required under federal law, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the commission and\napproved by EPA, will become federal law as part of the approved SIP required by 42 U.S.C.\n§7410 (FCAA, §110). The proposed rules will not affect private real property in a manner that\nwould require compensation to private real property owners under the United States\nConstitution or the Texas Constitution. The proposal also will not affect private real property in\na manner that restricts or limits an owner’s right to the property that would otherwise exist in\nthe absence of the governmental action. Therefore, the commission concludes that the\nproposed rulemaking will not cause a taking under Texas Government Code, Chapter 2007.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 67\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nConsistency with the Coastal Management Program\nThe commission reviewed this rulemaking for consistency with the CMP goals and policies in\naccordance with the regulations of the Coastal Coordination Advisory Committee and\ndetermined that the amendments are consistent with CMP goals and policies because the\nrulemaking is a fee rule, which is a procedural mechanism for paying for commission programs;\nwill not have direct or significant adverse effect on any coastal natural resource areas; will not\nhave a substantive effect on commission actions subject to the CMP; and promulgation and\nenforcement of the amendments will not violate (exceed) any standards identified in the\napplicable CMP goals and policies.\nWritten comments on the consistency of this rulemaking may be submitted to the contact\nperson at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this preamble.\nEffect on Sites Subject to the Federal Operating Permits Program\nChapter 101, Subchapter K would not require revisions to existing Federal Operating Permits\nunder 30 TAC §122, Federal Operating Permits Program.\nAnnouncement of Hearing\nThe commission will hold a virtual public hearing on this proposal on June 12, 2025, at 2:00\np.m. via virtual platform such as Microsoft Teams.

Applicability.\n(a) The provisions of this subchapter will become applicable in an area classified as\nsevere or extreme under the 2008 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard\n(NAAQS or standard) when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines that the\narea has failed to attain the standard by its applicable severe or extreme attainment date. The\ndetermination will be the effective date of EPA’s finding of failure to attain notice published in\nthe Federal Register.\n(b) Except as otherwise provided in §101.702 of this title (relating to Exemption), the\nprovisions of this subchapter apply to all regulated entities that meet the definition of major\nstationary sources of volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides located in a nonattainment\narea classified as severe or extreme for the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard.\n§101.702. Exemption.\nNo source subject to the Failure to Attain Fee under this subchapter is required to remit\nthe fee during any calendar year for which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 75\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nfinalized an extension of the attainment date for the nonattainment area applicable to the\nsource under the 2008 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard.\n§101.703. Fee Equivalency Account.\n(a) Fee Equivalency Account. The executive director will establish and maintain a Fee\nEquivalency Account to document revenue collected and available for use in demonstrating\nequivalency with the Area §185 Obligation. No actual money will be deposited into the Fee\nEquivalency Account. The Fee Equivalency Account will reflect equivalency credits based upon\nrevenue collected and made available for programs of the Texas Emissions Reduction Plan\n(TERP) under authority of the Texas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 386.\n(b) Revenue eligibility.

Fee Equivalency Accounting.\n(a) Fee Equivalency Account credits. Equivalency Credits will be on a dollar-for-dollar\nbasis and will not be discounted due to the passage of time. Equivalency Credits can be\naccumulated in the Fee Equivalency Account from year to year if a surplus exists in any given\nyear and used to offset the Area §185 Obligation determination.\n(b) Area §185 Obligation determination. Annually, the executive director will calculate\nthe applicable Area §185 Obligation for all major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts in\na severe or extreme 2008 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or\nstandard) nonattainment area by summing the Failure to Attain Fee for each major stationary\nsource or Section 185 Account. The summed amount will represent the calendar year Area §185\nObligation for the severe or extreme 2008 eight-hour ozone standard nonattainment area. The\nannual Area §185 Obligation will be calculated using actual emissions reported under §101.10\nof this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements) for the fee assessment year.\n(c) Annual demonstration of equivalency. The executive director will annually determine\nthe amount of equivalency credits available in the Fee Equivalency Account to determine the\nArea §185 Obligation calculated under this subsection. This demonstration will continue\nannually until the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard nonattainment area is no longer subject to\nthe fee according to the provisions of §101.718 of this title (relating to Cessation of the\nProgram).\n(1) The annual determination of equivalency will be calculated as follows.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 77\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nFigure: 30 TAC §101.704(c)(1)\n𝐹𝑒𝑒𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 = 𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑂𝑏𝑙𝑖𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 − 𝐹𝑒𝑒𝐸𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑣𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑡\nDefinitions:\nAreaObligation = The Area §185 Obligation calculated under subsection (c) of\nthis section representing the sum of the Failure to Attain Fee from all major stationary sources\nor Section 185 Accounts in the severe or extreme 2008 eight-hour ozone standard\nnonattainment area for a fee assessment year.\nFeeEquivAcct = Amount of Equivalency Credits in the Fee Equivalency Account as\ndetermined under §101.703 of this title (relating to Fee Equivalency Account).\nFeeBalance = The balance (amount remaining) in the Fee Equivalency Account\nafter the Equivalency Credits are applied to the Area §185 Obligation for a fee assessment year.\n(2) If the Fee Equivalency Account balance is calculated to be less than or equal\nto zero in paragraph (1) of this subsection, sufficient equivalency credits were available to\noffset the Area §185 Obligation. The executive director will not assess a Failure to Attain Fee on\nmajor stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts for the fee assessment year.\n(3) If the Fee Equivalency Account balance is calculated to be greater than zero in\nparagraph (1) of this subsection, insufficient equivalency credits were available to offset the fee\nobligation. The executive director will annually assess a sufficient Failure to Attain Fee to fulfill\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 78\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nthe Area §185 Obligation. The amount due from each major stationary source or Section 185\nAccount will be prorated to generate sufficient revenue to meet the Area §185 Obligation.

Baseline Amount.\n(a) Baseline amount. For the purposes of this subchapter, the baseline amount must be\ncalculated as the lower of the following:\n(1) total amount of baseline emissions; or\n(2) total annual emissions allowed under authorizations, including authorized\nemissions from maintenance, shutdown, and startup activities, applicable to the source in the\nbaseline year. Emissions from pending authorizations with administratively complete\napplications as of December 31 of the baseline year may be included in the total annual\nemissions allowed under authorizations.\n(b) Baseline emissions. For the purposes of this subchapter, the baseline emissions must\nbe calculated from:\n(1) the baseline year; or\n(2) a historical period, if the major stationary source’s or Section 185 Account’s\nemissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to year. Any single\n24-month consecutive period within a historical period preceding January 1 of the baseline year\nmay be used to calculate an average baseline emissions amount in tons per year for the major\nstationary source as the historical period. If used, the historical period must be:\n(A) ten years for non-electric utility steam generating units; or\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 80\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(B) five years for electrical utility steam generating units.\n(c) Historical period. If a major stationary source or Section 185 Account uses a\nhistorical period as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the baseline amount will:\n(1) use adequate data for calculating the equivalent alterative fee baseline\nemissions;\n(2) be adjusted downward to exclude any unauthorized emissions that occurred\nwhile the source was operating above an emissions limitation that was legally enforceable\nduring the consecutive 24-month period; and\n(3) be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions during the consecutive 24-\nmonth period that would have exceeded an emissions limitation for rules and regulations with\nwhich the source had to comply during the baseline year.\n(d) Adjustments. The baseline amounts must be adjusted downward to exclude any\nemissions that exceeded an emissions limit for rules or regulations in effect by December 31 of\nthe baseline year.\n(e) Emissions units. Baseline amounts must include all emissions units located at the\nmajor stationary source as of December 31 of the baseline year. When control or ownership of\nemission units changes during the baseline year, the emissions from those emission units will\nbe attributed to the major stationary source with control or ownership of the emissions unit on\nDecember 31 of the baseline year.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 81\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(f) Calculations. A baseline amount, reported in units of tons per year, must be\ncalculated separately for each pollutant, volatile organic compounds and/or nitrogen oxides,\nfor which the source meets the major source applicability requirements of §101.701 of this title\n(relating to Applicability).\n(g) Compliance schedule. The owner or operator of each major stationary source\nmeeting the requirements of §101.701 of this title must submit to the executive director a\nreport establishing its baseline amount on a form published by the executive director. The\nbaseline amounts forms must be submitted by the emissions inventory due date as specified\nunder §101.10 of this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements) for the fee\nassessment year, or 120 days after the effective date of a finding of failure to attain, whichever\nis later.\n(h) Review. Where the baseline amount does not align with information recorded in\neither the emissions inventory database or the air permitting data systems, the executive\ndirector may direct that the baseline amount be based on the lower of reported emissions\nunder §101.10 of this title or total annual authorized emissions. After review, the baseline\namount will be fixed and not be changed except as allowed under this subchapter.\n§101.706. Baseline Amount for New Major Stationary Sources.\n(a) Baseline amounts. A baseline amount must be established for major stationary\nsources or Section 185 Accounts that begin operating during or after the baseline year. The\nbaseline amount must use the first full year operation as major source and be the lower of:\n(1) total amount of baseline emissions; or\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 82\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(2) total annual emissions allowed under applicable authorizations, including\nemissions from maintenance, startup, and shutdown activities. Emissions from pending\nauthorizations with administratively complete applications as of the last day of the full first\ncalendar year of operation may be included in the total annual emissions allowed under\nauthorizations.\n(b) Adjustments. The baseline amount must be adjusted downward to exclude any\nemissions that exceeded an emissions limit for rules or regulations in effect by the last day of\nthe one-year period used to determine the baseline amount.\n(c) Emissions units. Baseline amounts must include all emissions units located at the\nmajor stationary source as of the last day of the one-year period used to determine the baseline\namount. When control or ownership of emission units changes during the calendar year, the\nemissions from those emission units will be attributed to the major stationary source with\ncontrol or ownership of the emission unit on the last day of the one-year period used to\ndetermine the baseline amount.\n(d) Calculations. A baseline amount, reported in units of tons per year, must be\ncalculated separately for each pollutant, volatile organic compounds and/or nitrogen oxides for\nwhich the source meets the major source applicability requirements of §101.701 of this title\n(relating to Applicability).\n(e) Compliance schedule. Within 90 calendar days of completing the first full year\noperating as a major stationary source, the major stationary source or Section 185 Account\nmust submit to the executive director a report establishing the baseline amount on a form\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 83\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\npublished by the executive director.\n(f) Review. Where the baseline amount does not align with information recorded in\neither the emissions inventory database or the air permitting data systems, the executive\ndirector may direct that the baseline amount be based on the lower of reported emissions\nunder §101.10 of this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements) or total annual\nauthorized emissions. After review, the baseline amount will be fixed and not change except as\nallowed under this subchapter.\n§101.707. Aggregated Baseline Amount.\n(a) Aggregation. After determining separate baseline amounts for each pollutant at each\nmajor stationary source or Section 185 Account according to the requirements of §101.705 of\nthis title (relating to Baseline Amount) or §101.706 of this title (relating to Baseline Amount for\nNew Major Stationary Sources), an owner or operator of a major stationary source or Section\n185 Account may choose to combine baseline amounts as follows:\n(1) volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions into a single aggregated\npollutant baseline amount for multiple major stationary sources under common control;\n(2) nitrogen oxides (NO ) emissions into a single aggregated pollutant baseline\nX\namount for multiple major stationary sources under common control;\n(3) emissions for both VOC and NO into a single aggregated pollutant baseline\nX\namount for a single major stationary source; and/or\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 84\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(4) emissions for both VOC and NO into a single aggregated pollutant baseline\nX\namount for multiple major stationary sources under common control.\n(b) Pollutant emissions aggregation. Pollutant emissions in an aggregated amount must\nhave:\n(1) the same time period for calculating the baseline amount; and\n(2) the same basis of baseline emissions or total annual authorized emissions to\ncalculate the baseline amount.\n(c) Section 185 Account reporting. An owner and or operator opting to combine VOC\nwith NO emissions and/or combine major stationary sources into one baseline amount must\nX\nidentify all major stationary sources being aggregated under this section.\n(d) Fee calculation requirement. The Failure to Attain Fee must be assessed and\ncalculated in the same manner that an owner or operator elects to aggregate under this section.\n(e) Compliance schedule. The owner or operator of each major stationary source or\nSection 185 Account must submit to the executive director a report establishing its aggregated\nbaseline amount on a form published by the executive director.\n(1) For major stationary sources or Section 185 Accounts that operated the entire\nbaseline year, the aggregated equivalent alternative baseline amount forms must be submitted\nby the emissions inventory due date as specified under §101.10 of this title (relating to\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 85\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nEmissions Inventory Requirements) for the fee assessment year, or 120 days after the finding of\nfailure to attain effective date in the Federal Register, whichever is later.\n(2) For major stationary sources or Section 185 Account that began operating\nduring or after the baseline year, the aggregated baseline amount forms must be submitted\nwithin 90 calendar days of completing the first full year operating as a major stationary source.\n(f) Review. Where the baseline amount does not align with information recorded in\neither the emissions inventory database or the air permit data systems, the executive director\nmay direct that the baseline amount be based on the lower of reported emissions under\n§101.10 of this title or total annual authorized emissions . After review, the baseline amount\nwill be fixed and not be changed except as allowed under this subchapter.\n§101.708. Adjustment of Baseline Amount for Major Stationary Sources with Less Than 24\nMonths of Operation.\n(a) Baseline amount. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or Section 185\nAccount may request adjustment of the baseline amount established under this subchapter if\nthe major stationary source or emissions units at the major stationary source experienced less\nthan 24 months of consecutive operation by December 31 of the baseline year. If the emissions\nwere irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to year, then the baseline\namount may be adjusted as the lower of the following:\n(1) total average amount of baseline emissions for the consecutive 24-month\nperiod; or\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 86\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(2) total annual emissions allowed under authorizations applicable to the major\nstationary source during the first year operating as a major stationary source. Emissions from\npending authorizations with administratively complete applications as of the last day of the\none-year period used to determine the baseline amount may be included in the total annual\nemissions allowed under authorizations.\n(b) Compliance schedule. Within 90 calendar days of completing 24 consecutive months\nof operation, the owner or operator of the major stationary source or Section 185 Account must\nsubmit to the executive director a request to adjust the baseline amount on a form published\nby the executive director.\n(c) Review. Where the baseline amount does not align with information recorded in\neither the emissions inventory database or the air permitting data systems, the executive\ndirector may direct that the baseline amount be based on the lower of reported emissions\nunder §101.10 of this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements) or total annual\nauthorized emissions. After review, the baseline amount will be fixed and not change except as\nallowed under this subchapter.\n(d) Fee assessment. After review, the adjusted baseline amount will be applied starting\nwith the fee assessment year after the review and will continue until the Failure to Attain Fee no\nlonger applies to the area as specified under §101.718 of this title (relating to Cessation of\nProgram). No refunds or credits will be applied to fees previously paid.\n§101.709.

The fee will be assessed and calculated using the same Failure to Attain\nFee determination method used under this subchapter. Actual VOC or NO emissions may be\nX\nkept separate or aggregated together. A single pollutant may be aggregated across multiple\nmajor stationary sources, or VOC and NO emissions may both be aggregated together across\nX\nmultiple major stationary sources. Aggregation as described under §101.707 of this title\n(relating to Aggregated Baseline Amount) is limited to emissions from:\n(1) major stationary sources that aggregated VOC baseline amounts;\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 93\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(2) major stationary sources that aggregated NO baseline amounts; or\nX\n(3) major stationary sources that aggregated VOC with NO baseline amounts.\nX\n(c) Assessment. The owner or operator of each major stationary source to which this\nrule applies must annually pay the Failure to Attain Fee to the commission calculated in\naccordance with either subsection (d) or (e) and subsection (f) of this section. The Failure to\nAttain Fee will be assessed on actual emissions of VOC and/or NO as recorded in the emissions\nX\ninventory under §101.10 of this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements), that\nexceed 80% of the pollutant baseline amount, rounded up to the nearest whole number.\n(d) Fee assessment for separate pollutants. The Failure to Attain Fee from major\nstationary sources that did not aggregate baseline amounts under §101.707 of this title will\nremain separate and due from each major stationary source or Section 185 Account for each\npollutant for which the source meets the major source applicability requirements. The fee will\nbe calculated separately by the formula in subsection (f) of this section.\n(e) Fee assessment for aggregated pollutants. The Failure to Attain Fee will be calculated\nin accordance with subsection (f) of this section and the method used for an aggregated\nbaseline amount determination as described under §101.707(a) of this title.\n(1) If VOC emissions are aggregated, VOC emissions from all major stationary\nsources in the Section 185 Account must be used for aggregated actual emissions and the\naggregated baseline emissions.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 94\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(2) If NO emissions are aggregated, NO emissions from all major stationary\nX X\nsources in the Section 185 Account must be used for the aggregated actual and aggregated\nbaseline emissions.\n(3) If VOC emissions are aggregated with NO emissions at one major stationary\nX\nsource, VOC and NO emissions must be used for the aggregated actual and aggregated baseline\nX\nemissions. If VOC emissions are aggregated with NO emissions across multiple major\nX\nstationary sources, VOC and NO emissions from each major stationary source in the Section\nX\n185 Account must be used for the aggregated actual and aggregated baseline emissions.\n(f) Fee calculations. The fee will be calculated for VOC, NO , or both pollutants’\nX\nemissions, as follows.\nFigure: 30 TAC §101.713(f)\n2 1\n§185Fee = $200 [( × 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡70𝑥) + ( × 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡70𝑦)] × [(𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 − (0.8 × 𝐵𝐴)]\n3 3\nDefinitions:\nPart70x = The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 70 fee published by the\nEPA for the 12 months that includes the fiscal year for the calendar year that a fee is being\nassessed.

Each emissions Failure to Attain Fee payment must be paid at\nthe time and in the manner and amount provided by this subsection. Failure to pay the full\nFailure to Attain Fee by the due date will result in enforcement action under Texas Water Code\n(TWC), §7.178.\n(e) Late payments. The agency will impose interest and penalties on owners or operators\nof a major stationary source or Section 185 Account who fail to make payment of emissions\nfees when due in accordance with Chapter 12 of this title (relating to Payment of Fees).\n§101.715. Eligibility for Other Failure to Attain Fee Fulfillment Options.\n(a) Alternative fulfillment options. Notwithstanding any requirement in this subchapter,\nthe owner or operator of a major stationary source or Section 185 Account required to pay a\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 97\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nFailure to Attain Fee may submit a request to the executive director to partially or completely\nfulfill the Failure to Attain Fee in compliance with §101.716 (relating to Relinquishing Credits to\nFulfill a Failure to Attain Fee and §101.717 of this title (relating to Using a Supplemental\nEnvironmental Project to Fulfill a Failure to Attain Fee).\n(b) Unfulfilled portions. If a Failure to Attain Fee cannot be completely fulfilled using\nalternate fulfillment options, then the unfulfilled portion of the Failure to Attain Fee is required\nto be calculated, assessed, and paid according to the provisions of this subchapter.\n(c) Reporting. The owner or operator of a major stationary source or Section 185\nAccount must inform the executive director if they choose an alternative fulfillment option for\nall or a portion of the Failure to Attain Fee as described in §101.716 and §101.717 of this title.\nThe request must be submitted on a form specified by the executive director and include a list\nof the emissions in tons of volatile organic compounds and/or nitrogen oxides requested from\nalternative fulfillment options, payment, or combination to cover the entire Failure to Attain\nFee.\n(d) Compliance schedule. No later than emissions inventory due date as specified under\n§101.10 of this title (relating to Emissions Inventory Requirements) for the first fee assessment\nyear and continuing annually, the owner or operator of a major stationary source or Section\n185 Account must submit the request specified in subsection (c) and ensure the following\nconditions are met:\n(1) all emissions credits under §101.716 of this title must be approved,\nexercised, or otherwise completed; and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 98\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(2) all Supplemental Environmental Projects under §101.717 of this title must be\napproved and funded.\n(e) If the executive director does not receive the notification request to use alternative\nfulfillment options for all or a portion of the Failure to Attain Fee or the alternate fulfillment\noptions are not approved and funded, exercised, or otherwise completed as required by this\nsubsection, the Failure to Attain Fee payment will be due in full as described under §101.714 of\nthis title (relating to Failure to Attain Fee Payment).\n§101.716. Relinquishing Credits to Fulfill a Failure to Attain Fee.\n(a) The owner or operator of a major stationary source or Section 185 Account subject\nto this subchapter may submit a request to partially or completely fulfill the Failure to Attain\nFee by substituting emissions reductions, on a volatile organic compounds-or nitrogen oxides-\nspecific basis, in an amount equivalent to the tons on which the Failure to Attain Fee has been\nassessed by relinquishing an equivalent amount of any combination of:\n(1) emissions reduction credits;\n(2) discrete emissions reduction credits;\n(3) current or banked Highly-Reactive Volatile Organic Compound Emissions Cap\nand Trade program allowances; and/or\n(4) current or banked Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program allowances.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 99\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(b) The use of the provisions of this section to fulfill a Failure to Attain Fee is subject to\nreview by the executive director.\n§101.717. Using a Supplemental Environmental Project to Fulfill a Failure to Attain Fee.\n(a) The owner or operator of a major stationary source or Section 185 Account subject\nto this subchapter may submit a request to partially or completely fulfill the Failure to Attain\nFee by contributing to a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP), on volatile organic\ncompounds (VOC) or nitrogen oxides (NO )-specific basis by either:\nX\n(1) an amount equivalent to the tons on which the Failure to Attain Fee has been\nassessed; or\n(2) an amount equivalent to the Failure to Attain Fee amount assessed.\n(b) The SEP must directly reduce the amount of VOC and/or NO emissions in the 2008\nX\neight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard nonattainment area.\n(c) The SEP must be enforceable through an Agreed Order or other enforceable\ndocument.\n(d) The use of SEP funds must be on a dollar-for-dollar basis and will not be discounted\ndue to the passage of time. Credit from SEP funds may be accumulated from year to year, and if\na surplus exists in any given year, the funds may be used to offset the calculated Failure to\nAttain Fee as needed.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 100\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\n(e) Funds in a SEP used to offset an administrative penalty cannot be used to offset a\nFailure to Attain Fee.\n(f) The use of a SEP to fulfill a Failure to Attain Fee is subject to approval by the\nexecutive director.\n§101.718. Cessation of Program.\n(a) The Failure to Attain Fee will continue to apply until one of the following actions is\nfinal:\n(1) the effective date of redesignation of the area classified as severe or extreme\nunder the 2008 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS or standard)\nto attainment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA);\n(2) any final action or final rulemaking by EPA to end the Failure to Attain fee; or\n(3) finding of attainment by EPA.\n(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, the Failure to Attain Fee will be\ncalculated but not invoiced, and the fee collection may be placed in abeyance by the executive\ndirector if three consecutive years of quality-assured data resulting in a design value that did\nnot exceed the 2008 eight-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), or a\ndemonstration indicating that the area would have attained by the attainment date but for\nemissions emanating from outside the United States, are submitted to EPA. The design value\nmay exclude days submitted to EPA by the executive director that exceeded the standard\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 101\nChapter 101 – General Air Quality Rules\nRule Project No. 2023-131-101-AI\nbecause of exceptional events. Fee collection will remain in abeyance until EPA takes final\naction on its review of the certified monitoring data and any demonstration(s)."

    "full_text": "Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 1\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ, agency, or commission)\nproposes amendments to 30 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) §§114.1, 114.2, 114.7,\n114.50, 114.51, 114.53, 114.60, 114.64, 114.66, 114.72, 114.80, 114.81, 114.82, 114.84,\nand 114.87.\nIf adopted, amended §§114.1, 114.2, 114.50, 114.51, 114.53, 114.80, 114.81, 114.82,\n114.84, and 114.87 will be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA) as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP).\nBackground and Summary of the Factual Basis for the Proposed Rules\nEighteen counties in Texas are subject to 30 TAC Chapter 114 inspection and\nmaintenance (I/M) rules and the I/M SIP: Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Johnson,\nKaufman, Parker, Rockwall, and Tarrant Counties in the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area;\nBrazoria, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, and Montgomery Counties in the Houston-\nGalveston-Brazoria (HGB) area; Travis and Williamson Counties in the Austin-Round\nRock (ARR) area; and El Paso County. The commission adopted revisions to Chapter\n114 and the I/M SIP on November 29, 2023, to implement an I/M program in Bexar\nCounty by no later than November 1, 2026 (Project Nos. 2022-026-114-AI and 2022-\n027-SIP-NR).\nThe I/M rules require the commission to implement the I/M program in conjunction\nwith the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) and require vehicles registered in I/M\ncounties to pass an emissions inspection at the time of their annual safety inspection.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 2\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nThe 88th Texas Legislature, 2023, Regular Session, passed two bills that impact the\nTexas I/M program and require rulemaking and a revision to the I/M SIP. House Bill\n(HB) 3297 eliminated the mandatory annual vehicle safety inspection program for\nnoncommercial vehicles, effective January 1, 2025. A rulemaking and SIP revision are\nrequired to remove references and requirements related to the state’s safety inspection\nprogram and to revise several provisions in the SIP that are outlined in the bill. Senate\nBill (SB) 2102 extends the initial registration and inspection period for rental vehicles\nfrom two years to three years. A rulemaking and SIP revision are required to allow one\nadditional year of exemption from emissions inspections for rental vehicles.\nThe rulemaking will also provide for an overall clean-up of the rule language to remove\noutdated program-related definitions, references, and requirements. This clean-up is a\nresult of the 2023 quadrennial rule review required for Chapter 114. The clean-up\nprocess will include revisions to the rule and SIP to remove a provision of the I/M rule\nrelated to vehicles operated by any federal government agency employee under the\njurisdiction of a federal government agency that has not been approved as part of the\nTexas SIP by EPA.\nDemonstrating Noninterference under Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA), §110(l)\nUnder FCAA, §110(l), EPA cannot approve a SIP revision if it would interfere with\nattainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), reasonable further\nprogress toward attainment, or any other applicable requirement of the FCAA. The\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 3\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\ncommission provides the following information to demonstrate why the proposed\nchanges to the I/M program rules in Chapter 114 will not negatively impact the status\nof the state’s progress towards attainment, interfere with control measures, or prevent\nreasonable further progress toward attainment of the ozone or carbon monoxide (CO)\nNAAQS.\nThe proposed amendments would revise 30 TAC Chapter 114, Subchapters A and C to\nimplement HB 3297 and provide for an overall clean-up of the rule language to remove\noutdated program-related definitions, references, and requirements. The requirement\nrelated to vehicles operated by any federal government agency employee under the\njurisdiction of a federal government agency, which would be removed from the I/M\nrule, has not been approved by EPA as part of the Texas SIP. These amendments do not\naffect EPA-approved I/M program requirements; therefore, the proposed rulemaking\nwould not negatively impact the state’s progress towards attainment of the ozone\nNAAQS or maintenance of the CO NAAQS.\nThe proposed amendments to Chapter 114 would also modify Subchapter C to\nimplement SB 2102, extending the initial registration and inspection period for rental\nvehicles to three years. TCEQ and DPS have implemented an I/M program that meets or\nexceeds the low-enhanced I/M performance standard required by 40 Code of Federal\nRegulations (CFR), Part 51. To implement the new requirements for Texas I/M\nprograms specified in SB 2102, TCEQ is proposing updates to the vehicle emissions\ntesting programs for the DFW area, HGB area, ARR area, Bexar County, and El Paso\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 4\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nCounty. The updated I/M program’s implementation year is anticipated to be 2026.\nEvaluating whether an updated I/M program meets EPA’s enhanced performance\nstandard requires demonstrating that the existing program emission rates for nitrogen\noxides and volatile organic compounds do not exceed the benchmark program’s\nemission rates. The benchmark program’s emission rates include a 0.02 grams per mile\nbuffer for each pollutant. Using the requirements in EPA guidance document,\nPerformance Standard Modeling for New and Existing Vehicle Inspection and\nMaintenance (I/M) Programs Using the MOVES Mobile Source Emissions Model (EPA-420-\nB-22-034, October 2022), TCEQ performed the required performance standard\nmodeling (PSM) analysis of the five program areas, as detailed in the accompanying HB\n3297 and SB 2102 Implementation I/M SIP Revision (Project Number 2025-013-SIP-NR).\nThe analysis demonstrates that the updated DFW area, HGB area, ARR area, Bexar\nCounty, and El Paso County I/M program emission rates do not exceed the\nperformance standard benchmark emission rates for all counties required to operate\nan I/M program within these areas. Therefore, the I/M program performance\nrequirement is met for the updated I/M program in all areas. Additionally, the PSM\nanalysis indicates that ozone precursor emission impacts due to the proposed I/M\nprogram updates will be negligible and would not be expected to interfere with any\napplicable FCAA requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress\nof the ozone NAAQS.\nData from the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) indicate that the number of\nrental vehicles titled in Texas that would be exempt under this provision is\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 5\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\napproximately 76,000. This is 0.3% of the overall Texas fleet. Additionally, these\nvehicles are expected to be the newest model year vehicles and, as such, are expected\nto meet the required emissions standards even though they are not tested since newer\nvehicles typically pass emissions inspections at higher rates than older vehicles. This\nproposed revision due to the passage of SB 2102 would not negatively impact the\nstate’s progress towards attainment of the 2008 and 2015 eight-hour ozone NAAQS.\nWhile PSM is not required by EPA for CO maintenance areas such as El Paso County,\nthis small percentage of the fleet is not expected to negatively impact maintenance of\nthe CO NAAQS in El Paso County, which is under an approved limited maintenance\nplan.\nSection by Section Discussion\nThe proposed amendments would revise the I/M program rules to provide for\nimplementation of HB 3297 and SB 2102 and would remove obsolete definitions.\nProposed amendments would also remove a state I/M requirement from the rule and\nstate-adopted SIP to be consistent with the EPA-approved federally enforceable Texas\nSIP. Amendments to clean up Chapter 114 rules result from the 2023 quadrennial rule\nreview process.\nThe commission also proposes non-substantive changes to update the rules in\naccordance with current Texas Register style and format requirements, improve\nreadability, establish consistency in the rules, and conform to the standards in the\nTexas Legislative Council Drafting Manual, September 2020. These non-substantive\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 6\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nchanges are not intended to alter the existing rule requirements in any way and may\nnot be specifically discussed in this preamble.\nSubchapter A: Definitions\n§114.1. Definitions\nThe proposed rulemaking would remove obsolete definitions in §114.1 that have been\naffirmed by staff as no longer necessary and would revise an additional definition. The\nobsolete definitions were associated with outdated references to safety inspections\nand first vehicle registration that are not used in or applicable to current rules in\nChapter 114 as proposed. The definitions proposed for removal are first safety\ninspection certificate and first vehicle registration. The definition for single sticker\ntransition date, which was needed temporarily to implement HB 2305, 83rd Texas\nLegislature, 2013, Regular Session, is not being proposed for removal in this\nrulemaking because it is referenced in Chapter 114, Subchapter B, which is not open\nfor this rulemaking. The commission may consider removing this outdated definition\nin a future rulemaking. The proposed revision to the definition for vehicle registration\ninsignia sticker would remove the reference to the single sticker transition date as that\ndate has passed and the reference is no longer necessary. The remaining definitions\nwould be renumbered as appropriate.\n§114.2. Inspection and Maintenance Definitions\nThe proposed rulemaking would remove obsolete definitions in §114.2 that have been\naffirmed by staff as no longer necessary, would revise additional definitions, and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 7\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nwould add one definition. The obsolete definitions were associated with outdated test\nsequences and definitions that are not used in or applicable to current rules in Chapter\n114 as proposed. The definitions proposed for removal are acceleration simulation\nmode (ASM-2) test, consumer price index, controller area network (CAN), low-volume\nemissions inspection station, two-speed idle (TSI) inspection and maintenance test, and\nuncommon part. The proposed revision to the definition for testing cycle would\nremove the reference to the single sticker transition date as previously defined.\nThe program area definitions in existing §114.2(10), which would be renumbered to\n§114.2(6), would be revised to combine the DFW program area definition in existing\nsubparagraph (A) with the extended DFW program area definition in existing\nsubparagraph (D) into a revised subparagraph (A). Existing subparagraph (D) would be\nremoved, and existing subparagraph (E) would be renumbered as (D). These proposed\namendments to the definition for program area would not change the meaning of the\nI/M program areas but would bring together all of the DFW area counties under one\nsubparagraph for clarity.\nThe proposed revisions would add a definition for rental vehicle in §114.2(7) to\naccommodate proposed rule amendments associated with implementation of SB 2102.\nThe remaining definitions would be renumbered as appropriate.\n§114.7. Low Income Vehicle Repair Assistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle\nRetirement Program Definitions\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 8\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nThe proposed revisions to §114.7 would update the definitions of automobile\ndealership, proof of transfer, and replacement vehicle. The statutory reference for\nautomobile dealership is not valid; therefore, the proposed revision would replace that\nterm with dealer to match the updated statutory reference in Texas Transportation\nCode (TTC) §503.001(4). Proposed revisions would also modify the definition to\nreference a person instead of a business, also to match the updated statutory\nreference. The proposed revision to proof of transfer would update the term\nautomobile dealer to dealer. The proposed revision to replacement vehicle would\nmodify the definition by removing the requirement that a vehicle have a passing safety\ninspection to be eligible as a replacement vehicle since the state’s mandatory annual\nvehicle safety inspection program for noncommercial vehicles was eliminated on\nJanuary 1, 2025. The definitions would be renumbered as appropriate.\nSubchapter C: Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance; Low Income Vehicle Repair\nAssistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program; and Early Action\nCompact Counties\n§114.50. Vehicle Emissions Inspection Requirements\nThe proposed revisions to §114.50 would add an emissions inspection exception for\nrental vehicles, combine I/M program applicability subsections, simplify language\nconcerning test procedures, remove references to the extended DFW program area,\nremove obsolete references to safety inspections, remove references to the single\nsticker transition date, and remove a provision that is not part of the EPA-approved\nI/M SIP for Texas.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 9\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nSubsection (a) would be revised to add an exception for rental vehicles under\nemissions inspection applicability provisions that extends their initial inspection\nperiod to three years. This amendment is proposed as a result of the passage of SB\n2102. Due to passage of HB 3297, which eliminated the mandatory annual vehicle\nsafety inspection program for noncommercial vehicles, the amendments to subsection\n(a) would include replacing a reference to safety inspection facilities with a reference\nto inspection facilities.\nThe proposed revisions would amend §114.50(a)(1) – (4) to combine the I/M program\ntest procedure and applicability provisions for the DFW program area, the HGB\nprogram area, and El Paso County under proposed §114.50(a)(1) for clarity and\nreadability, while also removing outdated references to program areas and other\noutdated references noted further below. The proposed revision would remove\nparagraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) and renumber the remaining paragraphs. The\nproposed revision would remove subparagraphs (a)(1)(A), (B), and (C) as the\nacceleration simulation mode (ASM) test is no longer used and only the on-board\ndiagnostic (OBD) test applies now. The proposed revisions would remove the\nreferences to the extended DFW program area in paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(1), (b)(3), and\n(b)(6) as that definition is no longer representative of the DFW program area. The\nproposed revisions would remove references to safety inspections in paragraphs\n(b)(1)(A) and (d)(1) that are no longer applicable to current rules in Chapter 114 due to\nthe passage of HB 3297. The proposed revisions would remove the references to the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 10\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nsingle sticker transition date in paragraphs (b)(1)(B) and (d)(2) as that date has passed\nand the references are no longer necessary. Existing §114.50(a)(5) would be\nrenumbered as §114.50(a)(2).\nThis proposed rulemaking would also remove §114.50(b)(2) related to vehicles\noperated by any federal government agency employee under the jurisdiction of a\nfederal government agency. The provision was first adopted in a 1999 rulemaking, and\nEPA has not approved this requirement as part of the SIP. EPA did not include the\nprovision in its final approval, published on November 14, 2001 (66 FR 57261). EPA\nindicated in an April 15, 2014, (79 FR 21179) action that it “will not approve or\ndisapprove the specific requirements of 30 TAC §114.50(b)(2)” because “EPA did not\nrequire the state to implement or adopt this reporting requirement dealing with\nfederal installation within I/M areas at the time of program approval.” Thus, removing\nthe provision would align the I/M program rules in Subchapter C, Division 1 with\nfederal program requirements and the I/M rules in the EPA-approved SIP. Since existing\nparagraph (b)(2) would be removed, subsequent paragraphs under subsection (b)\nwould be renumbered.\n§114.51. Equipment Evaluation Procedures for Vehicle Exhaust Gas Analyzers\nThe proposed revision to §114.51 would update the hyperlink location for the most\nrecent version of the \"Specifications for Vehicle Exhaust Gas Analyzer Systems for Use\nin the Texas Vehicle Emissions Testing Program.\"\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 11\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\n§114.53. Inspection and Maintenance Fees\nThe proposed revisions to §114.53 would combine I/M program fee requirements for\nseveral areas, add abbreviations, remove reference to the single sticker transition date,\nremove reference to the extended DFW program area, and remove language concerning\nfees associated with the outdated ASM test.\nAs with proposed amendments to §114.50, provisions in §114.53(a)(1) – (3) would be\nrevised to combine I/M program fee provisions for the DFW program area, the HGB\nprogram area, and El Paso County under a revised §114.53(a)(1). Existing paragraphs\n(2) and (3) would be removed, and existing §114.53(a)(4) would be renumbered as\nproposed §114.53(a)(2). The proposed revisions to §114.53(a)(4) would update the\nreference from §114.50(a)(5)(A) to §114.50(a)(2)(A) as it would be renumbered.\nThe proposed revisions to §114.53(d) would remove reference to the single sticker\ntransition date as that date has passed and the reference is no longer necessary.\nReference to the extended DFW program area in §114.53(d)(2) would be removed as\nthat definition is no longer necessary for describing the DFW area counties subject to\nI/M requirements, and language concerning the Low Income Vehicle Repair Assistance,\nRetrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program (LIRAP) fees in §114.53(d)(2)(A)\nand (B) and §114.53(d)(3)(A) and (B) would be revised to remove references to the\noutdated ASM test and associated LIRAP fee for that test.\n§114.60. Applicability for LIRAP\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 12\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nThe proposed revisions to §114.60 would update references to statute that were\namended by SB 1303, 82nd Texas Legislature, 2011, Regular Session. SB 1303 amended\nTHSC, §382.209(c)(1) by updating a reference of TTC, §§502.274 or 502.275 to TTC,\n§§504.501 or 504.502. SB 1303 was a general code update bill prepared by the Texas\nLegislative Council to make non-substantive amendments to enacted codes. TTC,\n§§502.274 and 502.275 had been removed from statute when HB 2971 repealed TTC,\nChapter 502, Subchapter F during the 78th Texas Legislature, 2003, Regular Session.\nThe proposed revisions would change the reference to TTC, §502.274 in §114.60(c)(4)\nto TTC, §504.501, add “custom vehicle or street rod” to match the statute, and remove\n“as defined by” since the new reference is not in a definitions section in the statute.\nThe proposed revisions would change the reference to TTC, §502.275 in §114.60(c)(5)\nto TTC, §504.502 and remove “as defined by” since the new reference is not a\ndefinitions section in the statute.\n§114.64. LIRAP Requirements\nThe proposed revisions to §114.64 would remove obsolete requirements related to\nsafety inspections and the ASM test, incorporate changes caused by renumbering, and\nupdate a term to match changes made to definitions. The proposed revisions to\n§114.64(b)(4) would remove a requirement made obsolete by the elimination of the\nmandatory annual vehicle safety inspection program for noncommercial vehicles as a\nresult of the passage of HB 3297. Subsequent paragraphs under subsection (b) would\nbe renumbered. The proposed revisions to §114.64(c)(1) would incorporate changes in\n§114.64(c)(1)(A) caused by renumbering in subsection (b), remove a requirement in\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 13\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\n§114.64(c)(1)(B) made obsolete by the elimination of the mandatory annual vehicle\nsafety inspection program for noncommercial vehicles as a result of the passage of HB\n3297 and by implementation of the state’s single sticker registration system, and\nremove redundant language in §114.64(c)(1)(C) that already appears in existing\n§114.64(b)(6). The proposed revisions to §114.64(c)(2) would remove an obsolete\nrequirement related to the outdated ASM test and renumber subsequent paragraphs\nunder subsection (c). The proposed revisions to §114.64(e) would remove a\nrequirement made obsolete by the elimination of the mandatory annual vehicle safety\ninspection program for noncommercial vehicles as a result of the passage of HB 3297.\nThe proposed revisions to §114.64(f) and (f)(1) would change the term “automobile\ndealership(s)” to “dealer(s)” to match the update proposed in §114.7.\n§114.66. Disposition of Retired Vehicle\nThe proposed revisions in §114.66(d) would change the term “automobile dealer” to\n“dealer” to match the update proposed in §114.7.\n§114.72. Local Advisory Panels\nThe proposed revisions to §114.72 would update obsolete references to statute,\nupdate a term to match changes made to definitions, and remove the provision that\nlocal advisory panels may consist of representatives from safety inspection facilities.\nThe proposed revisions to §114.72(a)(4) would update references to statute that were\namended by SB 1303, 82nd Texas Legislature, 2011, Regular Session to match the\nupdates made in §114.60. The proposed revisions would change the term “automobile\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 14\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\ndealerships” to “dealers” in §114.72(c)(1) to match the update proposed in §114.7. Low\nIncome Vehicle Repair Assistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program\nDefinitions. The proposed revisions would remove the provision in §114.72(c)(3) that\nlocal advisory panels may consist of representatives from safety inspection facilities\ndue to the elimination of the mandatory annual vehicle safety inspection program for\nnoncommercial vehicles as a result of the passage of HB 3297 and instead allow that\nthey may consist of representatives from emissions inspection facilities.\n§114.80. Applicability\nThe proposed revisions to §114.80 would add an emissions inspection exception for\nrental vehicles and remove obsolete references to safety inspections. The proposed\nrevisions to §114.80(c) would add an exception for rental vehicles under emissions\ninspection applicability provisions that extends their initial inspection period to three\nyears. This amendment is proposed as a result of the passage of SB 2102. Due to\npassage of HB 3297, which eliminated the mandatory annual vehicle safety inspection\nprogram for noncommercial vehicles, the amendments to §114.80(c) would include\nreplacing references to safety inspection and safety inspection facilities with\nreferences to emissions inspection and inspection facilities.\n§114.81. Vehicle Emissions Inspection Requirements\nThe proposed revisions in §114.81 would remove the references to the two-speed idle\n(TSI) test for pre-1996 vehicles that are no longer applicable in the program. The\nproposed revision would remove paragraph (2) and revise paragraphs (1) and (3) as the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 15\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nTSI test is no longer used and only the OBD test applies. The paragraphs in the section\nwould be renumbered as appropriate.\n§114.82. Control Requirements\nThe proposed revisions in §114.82 would remove references to the safety inspection,\nthe single sticker transition date, 1996 and newer model year vehicles, and the Texas\nMotor Vehicle Commission Code, and remove a subsection that corresponds to a\nsection not approved by EPA as part of the SIP. Section 114.82(a)(1) would be removed\nsince it only pertains to requirements prior to the single sticker transition date as that\ndate has passed and those requirements are no longer necessary. The proposed\nrevisions to §114.82(a)(2) would remove the reference to the single sticker transition\ndate and safety inspection requirements due to the elimination of the mandatory\nannual vehicle safety inspection program for noncommercial vehicles that resulted\nfrom the passage of HB 3297. Paragraphs of §114.82(a) would be renumbered as\nappropriate.\nThe proposed rulemaking would also remove §114.82(b) as it corresponds to\n§114.50(b)(2), related to vehicles operated by any federal government agency employee\nunder the jurisdiction of a federal government agency, which EPA has not approved as\npart of the SIP. Removing the provision would align the I/M program rules in\nSubchapter C, Division 1 with federal program requirements and the I/M rules in the\nEPA-approved SIP. Since existing subsection (b) would be removed, subsequent\nsubsections §114.82(c) through (h) under would be renumbered as §114.82(b) through\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 16\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\n(g). The proposed revisions to §114.82(c) would change the term “dealership(s)” to\n“dealer(s)” to match the update proposed in §114.7. Low Income Vehicle Repair\nAssistance, Retrofit, and Accelerated Vehicle Retirement Program Definitions. The\nproposed revisions to §114.82(g) would remove the reference to the Texas Motor\nVehicle Commission Code as it is no longer applicable and remove the reference to\n1996 and newer model year vehicles, as this age range of vehicles no longer needs to\nbe specified.\n§114.84. Prohibitions\nThe proposed revisions in §114.84 would remove obsolete references to safety\ninspections and the single sticker transition date that are no longer applicable to\ncurrent rules in Chapter 114. The proposed revision to §114.84(a) would remove the\nreference to the annual safety inspection due to the elimination of the mandatory\nannual vehicle safety inspection program for noncommercial vehicles that resulted\nfrom the passage of HB 3297. The proposed revision to §114.84(b) would remove an\nobsolete reference to the single sticker transition date that is no longer applicable as\nthat date has passed and the reference is no longer necessary.\n§114.87. Inspection and Maintenance Fees\nThe proposed revisions in §114.87 would remove obsolete references to the TSI test\nand the single sticker transition date and update the language used to refer to the\nemissions test. Subsections (a) and (d) would be revised to remove references to the\nsingle sticker transition date that are no longer applicable as that date has passed and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 17\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nthe references are no longer necessary. The proposed revisions to §114.87(a) would\nremove reference to the two-speed idle test as it is no longer used. The proposed\nrevisions to §114.87(a) would also change on-board diagnostic test to emissions test to\nmatch language used to refer to the test in §114.53(a).\nFiscal Note: Costs to State and Local Government\nKyle Girten, Analyst in the Budget and Planning Division, has determined that for the\nfirst five-year period the proposed rules are in effect, no fiscal implications are\nanticipated for the agency or for other units of state or local government from\nadministration or enforcement of the proposed rule.\nPublic Benefits and Costs\nMr. Girten determined that for each year of the first five years the proposed rules are\nin effect, the public benefit will be rules that are compliant with state law, specifically\nHB 3297 and SB 2102 from the 88th Texas Legislature, 2023, Regular Session.\nAdditionally, the public will benefit from the removal of outdated definitions,\nreferences, and requirements. The proposed rulemaking is not anticipated to result in\nfiscal implications for businesses or individuals.\nLocal Employment Impact Statement\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Local\nEmployment Impact Statement is not required because the proposed rulemaking does\nnot adversely affect a local economy in a material way for the first five years that the\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 18\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nproposed rule is in effect.\nRural Communities Impact Assessment\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that the proposed\nrulemaking does not adversely affect rural communities in a material way for the first\nfive years that the proposed rules are in effect. The rulemaking would apply to all\ncounties subject to I/M program requirements in the state, and most of these counties\nare in areas with higher populations.\nSmall Business and Micro-Business Assessment\nNo adverse fiscal implications are anticipated for small or micro-businesses due to the\nimplementation or administration of the proposed rule for the first five-year period\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nSmall Business Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\nThe commission reviewed this proposed rulemaking and determined that a Small\nBusiness Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required because the proposed rule does\nnot adversely affect a small or micro-business in a material way for the first five years\nthe proposed rules are in effect.\nGovernment Growth Impact Statement\nThe commission prepared a Government Growth Impact Statement assessment for this\nproposed rulemaking. The proposed rulemaking does not create or eliminate a\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 19\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\ngovernment program and will not require an increase or decrease in future legislative\nappropriations to the agency. The proposed rulemaking does not require the creation\nof new employee positions, eliminate current employee positions, nor require an\nincrease or decrease in fees paid to the agency. The proposed rulemaking amends an\nexisting regulation, and it does not create, expand, repeal, or limit this regulation. The\nproposed rulemaking does not increase or decrease the number of individuals subject\nto its applicability. During the first five years, the proposed rule should not impact\npositively or negatively the state’s economy.\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking considering the regulatory impact\nanalysis requirements of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225, and determined that\nthe proposed rulemaking does not meet the definition of a “Major environmental rule”\nas defined in that statute, and in addition, if it did meet the definition, would not be\nsubject to the requirement to prepare a regulatory impact analysis. A “Major\nenvironmental rule” means a rule, the specific intent of which is to protect the\nenvironment or reduce risks to human health from environmental exposure, and that\nmay adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy,\nproductivity, competition, jobs, the environment, or the public health and safety of the\nstate or a sector of the state. Additionally, the proposed rulemaking does not meet any\nof the four applicability criteria for requiring a regulatory impact analysis for a major\nenvironmental rule, which are listed in Tex. Gov’t Code Ann., §2001.0225(a). Tex. Gov’t\nCode Ann., §2001.0225 applies only to a major environmental rule, the result of which\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 20\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nis to: 1) exceed a standard set by federal law, unless the rule is specifically required by\nstate law; 2) exceed an express requirement of state law, unless the rule is specifically\nrequired by federal law; 3) exceed a requirement of a delegation agreement or contract\nbetween the state and an agency or representative of the federal government to\nimplement a state and federal program; or 4) adopt a rule solely under the general\npowers of the agency instead of under a specific state law.\nThe proposed rulemaking’s purpose is to remove references and requirements related\nto the state’s safety inspection program due to the passage of HB 3297 and revise\nseveral provisions in the SIP that are outlined in the bill; and allow one additional year\nof exemption from emissions inspections for rental vehicles due to the passage of SB\n2102 to comply with federal requirements for the implementation of control strategies\nnecessary to attain and maintain the NAAQS for ozone or CO mandated by 42 United\nStates Code (U.S.C.) §7410, FCAA, §110. The requirement to implement and enforce\nI/M programs is specifically required for certain nonattainment areas by the FCAA, and\nthe proposed revisions to 30 TAC Chapter 114 would be used as a control strategy for\ndemonstrating attainment of the ozone or CO NAAQS in the specific areas designated\nas nonattainment in Texas, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble.\nThe proposed rulemaking implements requirements of the FCAA, 42 U.S.C. §7410,\nwhich requires states to adopt a SIP that provides for the implementation,\nmaintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS in each air quality control region of the\nstate. While 42 U.S.C. §7410 generally does not require specific programs, methods, or\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 21\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nreductions in order to meet the standard, I/M programs are specifically required by the\nFCAA. The SIP must also include enforceable emission limitations and other control\nmeasures, means, or techniques (including economic incentives such as fees,\nmarketable permits, and auctions of emissions rights), as well as schedules and\ntimetables for compliance as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable\nrequirements of the FCAA. The provisions of the FCAA recognize that states are in the\nbest position to determine what programs and controls are necessary or appropriate in\norder to meet the NAAQS, and when programs are specifically required, states may\nimplement them with flexibility allowed under the statute and EPA rules. This\nflexibility allows states, affected industry, and the public to collaborate on the best\nmethods for attaining the NAAQS for the specific regions in the state. Even though the\nFCAA allows states to develop their own programs, this flexibility does not relieve a\nstate from developing a program that meets the requirements of 42 U.S.C. §7410.\nStates are not free to ignore the requirements of 42 U.S.C. §7410 and must develop\nprograms to assure that their contributions to nonattainment areas are reduced so that\nthese areas can be brought into attainment on the schedule prescribed by the FCAA.\nIf a state does not comply with its obligations under 42 U.S.C. §7410, FCAA, §110 to\nsubmit SIPs, states are subject to discretionary sanctions under 42 U.S.C. §7410(m) or\nmandatory sanctions under 42 U.S.C. §7509, FCAA, §179; as well as the imposition of a\nfederal implementation plan (FIP) under 42 U.S.C. §7410, FCAA, §110(c).\nAs discussed earlier in this preamble, states are required to adopt SIPs with\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 22\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nenforceable emission limitations and other control measures, means, or techniques, as\nwell as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may be necessary or appropriate\nto meet the applicable requirements of the FCAA. As discussed in the FISCAL NOTE\nportion of this preamble, the proposed rules are not anticipated to add any significant\nadditional costs to affected individuals or businesses beyond what is necessary to\nattain the ozone or CO NAAQS or comply with the specific requirements for I/M\nprograms on the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs,\nthe environment, or the public health and safety of the state or a sector of the state.\nThe requirement to provide a fiscal analysis of regulations in the Texas Government\nCode was amended by SB 633 during the 75th legislative session. The intent of SB 633\nwas to require agencies to conduct a regulatory impact analysis of extraordinary rules.\nThese are identified in the statutory language as major environmental rules that will\nhave a material adverse impact and will exceed a requirement of state law, federal law,\nor a delegated federal program, or are adopted solely under the general powers of the\nagency. With the understanding that this requirement would seldom apply, the\ncommission provided a cost estimate for SB 633 that concluded “based on an\nassessment of rules adopted by the agency in the past, it is not anticipated that the bill\nwill have significant fiscal implications for the agency due to its limited application.”\nThe commission also noted that the number of rules that would require assessment\nunder the provisions of the bill was not large. This conclusion was based, in part, on\nthe criteria set forth in the bill that exempted rules from the full analysis unless the\nrule was a major environmental rule that exceeds a federal law.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 23\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nAs discussed earlier in this preamble, the FCAA does not always require specific\nprograms, methods, or reductions in order to meet the NAAQS, but I/M programs are\nspecifically required by the FCAA; thus, states must develop programs for each area\ncontributing to nonattainment to help ensure that those areas will meet the required\nattainment deadlines and that comply with EPA requirements for I/M programs.\nBecause of the ongoing need to meet federal requirements, the commission routinely\nproposes and adopts rules incorporating or designed to satisfy specific federal\nrequirements. The legislature is presumed to understand this federal scheme. If each\nrule proposed by the commission to meet a federal requirement was considered to be a\nmajor environmental rule that exceeds federal law, then each of those rules would\nrequire the full regulatory impact analysis (RIA) contemplated by SB 633. Requiring a\nfull RIA for all federally required rules is inconsistent with the conclusions reached by\nthe commission in its cost estimate and by the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) in its\nfiscal notes. Since the legislature is presumed to understand the fiscal impacts of the\nbills it passes, and that presumption is based on information provided by state\nagencies and the LBB, then the intent of SB 633 is presumed to only to require the full\nRIA for rules that are extraordinary in nature. While the proposed rules may have a\nbroad impact, that impact is no greater than is necessary or appropriate to meet the\nrequirements of the FCAA and creates no additional impacts since the proposed rules\ndo not impose burdens greater than required to demonstrate attainment of the ozone\nor CO NAAQS and comply with the requirements for I/M programs, as discussed\nelsewhere in this preamble.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 24\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nFor these reasons, the proposed rules fall under the exception in Texas Government\nCode, §2001.0225(a) because they are required by, and do not exceed, federal law. The\ncommission has consistently applied this construction to its rules since this statute\nwas enacted in 1997. Since that time, the legislature has revised the Texas Government\nCode but left this provision substantially unamended. It is presumed that “when an\nagency interpretation is in effect at the time the legislature amends the laws without\nmaking substantial change in the statute, the legislature is deemed to have accepted\nthe agency’s interpretation.” (Central Power & Light Co. v. Sharp, 919 S.W.2d 485, 489\n(Tex. App. Austin 1995), writ denied with per curiam opinion respecting another issue,\n960 S.W.2d 617 (Tex. 1997); Bullock v. Marathon Oil Co., 798 S.W.2d 353, 357 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 1990, no writ). Cf. Humble Oil & Refining Co. v. Calvert, 414 S.W.2d 172\n(Tex. 1967); Dudney v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 9 S.W.3d 884, 893 (Tex. App.\nAustin 2000); Southwestern Life Ins. Co. v. Montemayor, 24 S.W.3d 581 (Tex. App.\nAustin 2000, pet. denied); and Coastal Indust. Water Auth. v. Trinity Portland Cement\nDiv., 563 S.W.2d 916 (Tex. 1978).) The commission’s interpretation of the RIA\nrequirements is also supported by a change made to the Texas Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA) by the legislature in 1999. In an attempt to limit the number of\nrule challenges based upon APA requirements, the legislature clarified that state\nagencies are required to meet these sections of the APA against the standard of\n“substantial compliance” (Texas Government Code, §2001.035). The legislature\nspecifically identified Texas Government Code, §2001.0225 as subject to this standard.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 25\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nAs discussed in this analysis and elsewhere in this preamble, the commission has\nsubstantially complied with the requirements of Texas Government Code, §2001.0225.\nThe proposed rules implement the requirements of the FCAA, as discussed in this\nanalysis and elsewhere in this preamble. The proposed rules were determined to be\nnecessary to attain the ozone or CO NAAQS and comply with requirements for I/M\nprograms and will not exceed any standard set by state or federal law. These proposed\nrules are not an express requirement of state law. The proposed rules do not exceed a\nrequirement of a delegation agreement or a contract between state and federal\ngovernment, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the commission and approved by\nEPA, will become federal law as part of the approved SIP required by 42 U.S.C. §7410,\nFCAA, §110. The proposed rules were not developed solely under the general powers\nof the agency but are authorized by specific sections of Texas Health and Safety Code,\nChapter 382 (also known as the Texas Clean Air Act), and the Texas Water Code, which\nare cited in the Statutory Authority section of this preamble, including THSC,\n§§382.011, 382.012, and 382.017. Therefore, this proposed rulemaking action is not\nsubject to the regulatory analysis provisions of Texas Government Code,\n§2001.0225(b).\nThe commission invites public comment regarding the Draft Regulatory Impact\nAnalysis Determination during the public comment period. Written comments on the\nDraft Regulatory Impact Analysis Determination may be submitted to the contact\nperson at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 26\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nTakings Impact Assessment\nUnder Texas Government Code, §2007.002(5), taking means a governmental action that\naffects private real property, in whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a\nmanner that requires the governmental entity to compensate the private real property\nowner as provided by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution or §17 or §19, Article I, Texas Constitution; or a governmental action that\naffects an owner’s private real property that is the subject of the governmental action,\nin whole or in part or temporarily or permanently, in a manner that restricts or limits\nthe owner’s right to the property that would otherwise exist in the absence of the\ngovernmental action; and is the producing cause of a reduction of at least 25 percent\nin the market value of the affected private real property, determined by comparing the\nmarket value of the property as if the governmental action is not in effect and the\nmarket value of the property determined as if the governmental action is in effect.\nThe commission completed a takings impact analysis for the proposed rulemaking\naction under the Texas Government Code, Chapter 2007. The primary purpose of this\nproposed rulemaking action, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble, is to meet\nfederal requirements for the implementation of I/M programs and control strategies\nnecessary to attain and maintain the NAAQS for ozone or CO mandated by 42 U.S.C.\n§7410, FCAA, §110. Therefore, Chapter 2007 does not apply to this proposed\nrulemaking because it is an action reasonably taken to fulfill an obligation mandated\nby federal law, as provided by Texas Government Code, §2007.003(b)(4).\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 27\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nAs discussed elsewhere in this preamble, the proposed rulemaking implements\nrequirements of FCAA, 42 U.S.C. §7410, which requires states to adopt a SIP that\nprovides for the implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of the NAAQS in each\nair quality control region of the state. While 42 U.S.C. §7410 generally does not require\nspecific programs, methods, or reductions in order to meet the standard, I/M\nprograms are specifically required by the FCAA. The SIP must include enforceable\nemission limitations and other control measures, means, or techniques (including\neconomic incentives such as fees, marketable permits, and auctions of emissions\nrights), as well as schedules and timetables for compliance as may be necessary or\nappropriate to meet the applicable requirements of the FCAA. The provisions of the\nFCAA recognize that states are in the best position to determine what programs and\ncontrols are necessary or appropriate in order to meet the NAAQS. This flexibility\nallows states, affected industry, and the public, to collaborate on the best methods for\nattaining the NAAQS for the specific regions in the state. Even though the FCAA allows\nstates to develop their own programs, this flexibility does not relieve a state from\ndeveloping a program that meets the requirements of 42 U.S.C. §7410. States are not\nfree to ignore the requirements of 42 U.S.C. §7410 and must develop programs to\nassure that their contributions to nonattainment areas are reduced so that these areas\ncan be brought into attainment on the schedule prescribed by the FCAA.\nStates are required to adopt SIPs with enforceable emission limitations and other\ncontrol measures, means, or techniques, as well as schedules and timetables for\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 28\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\ncompliance, as may be necessary or appropriate to meet the applicable requirements\nof the FCAA. If a state does not comply with its obligations under 42 U.S.C. §7410,\nFCAA, §110 to submit SIPs, states are subject to discretionary sanctions under 42\nU.S.C. §7410(m) or mandatory sanctions under 42 U.S.C. §7509, FCAA, §179; as well as\nthe imposition of a federal implementation plan (FIP) under 42 U.S.C. §7410, FCAA,\n§110(c).\nIn addition, the commission’s assessment indicates that Texas Government Code,\nChapter 2007 does not apply to these proposed rules because this action is taken in\nresponse to a real and substantial threat to public health and safety; that is designed\nto significantly advance the health and safety purpose; and that it does not impose a\ngreater burden than is necessary to achieve the health and safety purpose. Thus, this\naction is exempt under Texas Government Code, §2007.003(b)(13). The proposed rules\nfulfill the FCAA requirement for states to create plans including control strategies to\nattain and maintain the NAAQS, as discussed elsewhere in this preamble. The\nproposed rules would assist in achieving the timely attainment of the ozone or CO\nNAAQS and reduced public exposure to ozone or CO. The NAAQS are promulgated by\nthe EPA in accord with the FCAA, which requires EPA to identify and list air pollutants\nthat “cause[s] or contribute[s] to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to\nendanger public health and welfare” and “the presence of which in the ambient air\nresults from numerous or diversion mobile or stationary sources,” as required by 42\nU.S.C. §7408. For those air pollutants listed, EPA then is required to issue air quality\ncriteria identifying the latest scientific knowledge regarding on adverse health and\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 29\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nwelfare effects associated with the listed air pollutant, in accord with 42 U.S.C. §7408.\nFor each air pollutant for which air quality criteria have been issued, EPA must publish\nproposed primary and secondary air quality standards based on the criteria that\nspecify a level of air quality requisite to protect the public health and welfare from any\nknown or anticipated adverse effects associated with the presence of the air pollutant\nin the ambient air, as required by 42 U.S.C. §7409. As discussed elsewhere in this\npreamble, states have the primary responsibility to adopt plans designed to attain and\nmaintain the NAAQS.\nThe proposed rules will not create any additional burden on private real property\nbeyond what is required under federal law, as the proposed rules, if adopted by the\ncommission and approved by EPA, will become federal law as part of the approved SIP\nrequired by 42 U.S.C. §7410, FCAA, §110. The proposed rules will not affect private\nreal property in a manner that would require compensation to private real property\nowners under the United States Constitution or the Texas Constitution. The proposal\nalso will not affect private real property in a manner that restricts or limits an owner’s\nright to the property that would otherwise exist in the absence of the governmental\naction. Therefore, the proposed rulemaking will not cause a taking under Texas\nGovernment Code, Chapter 2007. For these reasons, Texas Government Code, Chapter\n2007 does not apply to this proposed rulemaking.\nConsistency with the Coastal Management Program\nThe commission reviewed the proposed rulemaking and found the proposal is a\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality Page 30\nChapter 114 – Control of Air Pollution from Motor Vehicles\nRule Project No. 2025-012-114-AI\nrulemaking identified in the Coastal Coordination Act Implementation Rules, 31 TAC\n§29.11(b)(2) relating to rules subject to the Coastal Management Program, and will,\ntherefore, require that goals and policies of the Texas Coastal Management Program\n(CMP) be considered during the rulemaking process.\nNote: §29.11(b)(2) applies only to air pollutant emissions, on-site sewage disposal\nsystems, and underground storage tanks. Section 29.11(b)(4) applies to all other\nactions. The commission reviewed this rulemaking for consistency with the CMP goals\nand policies in accordance with the regulations of the Coastal Coordination Advisory\nCommittee and determined that the rulemaking and SIP revision would ensure that the\namendments comply with 40 CFR Part 50, National Primary and Secondary Air Quality\nStandards, and 40 CFR Part 51, Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal\nof Implementation Plan and is, therefore, consistent with CMP goals and policies.\nWritten comments on the consistency of this rulemaking may be submitted to the\ncontact person at the address listed under the Submittal of Comments section of this\npreamble.\nAnnouncement of Hearing\nThe commission will offer a virtual public hearing on this proposal on May 29, 2025, at\n2:00 p.m. The hearing is structured for the receipt of oral or written comments by\ninterested persons.
